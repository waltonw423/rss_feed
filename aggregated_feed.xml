Frankly, I am at a loss to understand how such a grave error could occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My thoughts are with the victim and her family at this deeply distressing time. They have shown immense courage, and they deserve our full support and protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a serious failure of the justice system, and people will rightly be outraged. It is completely unacceptable. The public has a right to expect that those convicted of serious crimes remain securely in custody. Public safety must never be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope Kebatu is located and returned to prison without delay. There must also be a full and transparent investigation into how this happened, and what safeguards will be put in place to ensure it never happens again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/oct/25/hadush-gerberslasie-kebatu-manhunt-met-police-sex-offender-london-latest-news"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/oct/25/hadush-gerberslasie-kebatu-manhunt-met-police-sex-offender-london-latest-news</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 12:52:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891gzx7xn4o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss</link><description>The deployment marks a major escalation in what the US says is a campaign against drug traffickers, which Trump warns will include "land action".</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891gzx7xn4o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 12:48:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Labour’s new deputy leader Lucy Powell says she wants Starmer to succeed but party must change – as it happened</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/25/new-labour-deputy-leader-lucy-powell-bridget-phillipson-uk-politics-latest-news-updates</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This blog is now closed, you can read more on this story &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/25/lucy-powell-wins-labour-deputy-leadership-election"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Powell&lt;/strong&gt; has paid tribute to former Labour deputy leader &lt;strong&gt;Angela Rayner&lt;/strong&gt;, saying she has some “big shoes to fill”, as she took to the stage to celebrate her win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powell spoke about how “division and hate” has increased.

They feel if they can march through our borough with impunity, they can go anywhere.

It was 89 years ago this month that local people, many of them British Jews, drove out Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirt militia from Whitechapel in the East End, in what has become known as the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/28/battle-of-cable-street-family-history-jewish-blackshirts-racism"&gt;Battle of Cable Street&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/25/history-repeating-fight-against-far-right-in-london-east-end"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/25/history-repeating-fight-against-far-right-in-london-east-end</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 12:04:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>RFK Jr to urge Americans to eat more saturated fats, alarming health experts</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/rfk-jr-saturated-fats</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Guidance from health and human services secretary contradicts decades of dietary recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, the health and human services secretary, is planning to issue guidance encouraging Americans to &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5563449-rfk-jr-saturated-fats-health-guidance-maha-hhs/"&gt;eat more saturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, contradicting &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9794145/"&gt;decades of dietary recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and alarming experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My response and sort of counsel to myself was to stay calm, and let’s see what happens, because there was no indication given as to how, why, when this potential shift would occur,” said Cheryl Anderson, an American Heart Association board member and professor at the University of California, San Diego’s school of public health and human longevity science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/rfk-jr-saturated-fats"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/rfk-jr-saturated-fats</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 12:00:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>'I am not done' - Kamala Harris tells BBC she may run for president again</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n7k2veywo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss</link><description>The former US vice-president made her strongest suggestion to date she will make another bid for the White House</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n7k2veywo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 12:00:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Digest of Recent Articles on Just Security (Oct. 20-24, 2025)</title><link>https://www.justsecurity.org/122887/digest-recent-articles-just-security-oct-20-24-2025/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=digest-recent-articles-just-security-oct-20-24-2025</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Series: International Law Weekend 2025 • U.S. strikes / Venezuela • Russia-Ukraine War • Israel-Hamas War • United Nations / Global inequality • Trump executive actions • Supreme Court / U.S. military • Series: When Guardrails Erode • Cyber • Violent extremism • Civilian harm • Civil society&lt;/p&gt;
