You can use it to track filings on topics like &lt;em&gt;rate cases&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;interconnection&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;queues&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;resource planning&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;distributed energy programs&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;data center load growth&lt;/em&gt;. It also allows you to set custom alerts so you’re notified when new filings mention them across multiple states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, I’ve used it to trace how “grid modernization” appears in filings across different states and found early draft documents that would’ve taken a significant amount of time to locate manually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s completely free to use, we’re just looking for feedback on how it could better support the energy community. Feel free to try it here: [&lt;a href="https://app.halcyon.io/workspaces/preview"&gt;Halcyon Search&lt;/a&gt;] and please reach out with any questions or feedback!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/1ih2eurm3swf1.png?width=3416&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=394709f20a1e946a23eeb938225fec8099934557"&gt;Halcyon Search: grid modernization results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Specialist-Cream2963"&gt; /u/Specialist-Cream2963 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1odsm9u/sharing_a_free_tool_to_help_dig_through_multiple/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1odsm9u/sharing_a_free_tool_to_help_dig_through_multiple/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 03:13:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Wood burners linked to 2,500 deaths a year in the UK, analysis finds</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/23/wood-burners-linked-to-2500-deaths-a-year-in-the-uk-analysis-finds</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Use of wood-burning stoves and fires in homes is mostly unnecessary and their toxic pollution costs the NHS millions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burning of wood and coal in homes contributes to almost 2,500 deaths a year in the UK, analysis has found.
