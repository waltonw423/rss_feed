These things happen. But all will be well, because Reform have just the MP for you. Someone who can be passed off as a safeish pair of hands. Someone who won’t frighten the horses. Too much. Step forward Danny Kruger. Just don’t look too close into his eyes. Not even Danny knows quite who Danny really is. Sometimes you have to judge a man by the company he keeps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kruger is the latest Reform recruit, having jumped ship from the Tories just over a month ago. Not necessarily a huge loss to Kemi Badenoch as Danny has proved time and again that his judgement is anything but infallible. But that hasn’t put him off. Because even when he’s wrong, Danny manages to convince himself that he’s right. Put simply, he’s not nearly as bright as he believes himself to be. Yet still somehow clever enough to convince Nige that he be admitted as one of the brains of the Reform operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/28/reform-wheels-out-danny-kruger-brains-nigel-farage-operation"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/28/reform-wheels-out-danny-kruger-brains-nigel-farage-operation</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:29:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Brazil: at least 60 reported killed in Rio’s worst day of violence amid police favela raids</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/brazil-rio-at-war-police-drug-raids-favelas</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Governor says city ‘at war’ after gunfights between troops and Red Command drug traffickers who reportedly used weaponised drones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 60 people have reportedly been killed in Rio’s worst-ever day of violence as more than 2,500 officers and special forces stormed an area of favelas near Rio’s international airport that is considered the headquarters of one of Brazil’s most powerful organised crime groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The predawn raid sparked intense gunfights in and around Alemão and Penha favelas, which are home to an estimated 300,000 people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/brazil-rio-at-war-police-drug-raids-favelas"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/brazil-rio-at-war-police-drug-raids-favelas</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:24:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>OpenAI Restructures as For-Profit Company</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/technology/openai-restructure-for-profit-company.html</link><description>The artificial intelligence company said the nonprofit that controlled the organization would receive a $130 billion stake in the new company.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/technology/openai-restructure-for-profit-company.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:21:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Gavin Newsom tells supporters of redistricting proposal to ‘stop donating’</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/gavin-newsom-prop-50-donations-california</link><description>&lt;p&gt;California governor launched the effort to counter Texas’s gerrymander and has far out-raised measure’s opponents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With just one week before California voters are set to head to the polls to decide on the state’s redistricting proposal, Gavin Newsom sent an unexpected message to would-be donors: keep your money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have hit our budget goals and raised what we need in order to pass Proposition 50.

On a single transmission project, we're juggling:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hundreds (or thousands) of individual landowners&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Multiple county and municipal governments, each with its own agenda&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Various environmental and conservation groups&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tribal nations with historical claims and consultation rights&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Local business associations, agricultural groups, etc,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;And we're tracking all this on spreadsheets and it's NOT working.

He said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me be very clear. The growth of the civil service will be reversed. After falling in the wake of the global financial crisis, the headcount of the civil service rose again after Brexit – shame on the Tories – and it passed 500,000 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing works properly. It’s impossible to build anything. The streets are dirty and unsafe. Taxes and prices are far too high. Immigration is changing our country for the worse and far too fast. And we’re becoming poor, sick and unhappy. There is a malaise over Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These problems are complex. But the effective cause of them is simple. Since 1997 we have had governments that, firstly don’t share the attitude of the country they govern, and secondly, they aren’t properly in charge of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This announcement only reinforces climate policy as a dividing line in our politics, rather than being the unifying issue it once was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, for the Conservative party, it risks chasing votes from Reform at the expense of the wider electorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By undermining the judiciary we further erode public trust in the institutions of our democracy and therefore in democracy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I say to those seeking to villainise a judiciary that cannot easily answer back, who wilfully discredit our legal system for their own expediency – it’s time to show responsible leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not just about short-term decisions to make it easier to deal with public concerns about immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our support for human rights has its origin in Magna Carta. How we deal with issues of human rights is fundamental to our ability to deal with autocracies and dictatorships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world of power where the club of strong men want to carve the world up in their own interests, populism and polarisation are enablers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those politicians in the Western world who use populism and polarisation for their own short-term political ends risk handing a victory to our enemies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/28/labour-asylum-seekers-military-sites-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-reform-uk-yvette-cooper-uk-politics-live-news-latest-updates"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/28/labour-asylum-seekers-military-sites-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-reform-uk-yvette-cooper-uk-politics-live-news-latest-updates</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 17:03:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Gambling does not cause any ‘social ills’, lobbyist tells incredulous MPs</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/28/gambling-does-not-cause-any-social-ills-lobbyist-grainne-hurst-tells-incredulous-mps</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Head of UK’s Betting and Gaming Council was asked to repeat claim as she spoke against increasing taxes on sector in November budget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/28/labour-asylum-seekers-military-sites-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-reform-uk-yvette-cooper-uk-politics-live-news-latest-updates"&gt;UK politics live – latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boss of the UK’s main betting and gaming lobby group has told MPs that there is no “social ill with gambling” as she warned against imposing higher taxes on the sector in the November budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grainne Hurst, the chief executive of the Betting and Gaming Council, repeatedly made the statement to parliament’s Treasury select committee on Tuesday, where she also claimed that higher taxes would result in thousands of job losses and push punters into using hidden market services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/28/gambling-does-not-cause-any-social-ills-lobbyist-grainne-hurst-tells-incredulous-mps"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/28/gambling-does-not-cause-any-social-ills-lobbyist-grainne-hurst-tells-incredulous-mps</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 17:01:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>SigNoz (YC W21) Is Hiring DevRel Engineers in the US – Open Source O11y Platform</title><link>https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/SigNoz/8447522c-1163-48d0-8f55-fac25f64a0f3</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45735491"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/SigNoz/8447522c-1163-48d0-8f55-fac25f64a0f3</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 17:00:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Who’s Behind A New Black Sea Luxury Resort Complex?
