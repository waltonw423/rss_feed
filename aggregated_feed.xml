  &lt;p&gt;As the thawing Arctic’s geostrategic importance grows, military and economic objectives are becoming increasingly intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Russian expansionism in the Arctic is increasingly becoming a key security challenge for Europe. Despite much of Russia’s resources being used for the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin has continued to invest heavily in building out its presence and revamping its existing bases in the Arctic. The region is becoming a hotbed for hybrid activity. Russia sealed off large swathes of the Barents Sea, including parts of Norway’s exclusive economic zone, for its most recent Zapad-2025 exercises with Belarus, and practised &lt;a href="https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/security/cruise-missiles-over-franz-josef-land/437021"&gt;cruise missile launches&lt;/a&gt; over the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European countries and their NATO allies have started to push back &lt;a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/what-know-about-uss-gerald-r-fords-arctic-mission-bw-093025"&gt;more forcefully&lt;/a&gt;. The accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO means that the alliance now counts seven of the eight &lt;a href="https://arctic-council.org/about/states/"&gt;traditional Arctic states&lt;/a&gt; as members – a development Moscow has described as a ‘hostile encirclement’. Over the past few months, NATO ships have &lt;a href="https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/security/nato-group-sailed-the-barents-sea-as-russia-launched-multiple-missiles-in-exercise/434170"&gt;repeatedly patrolled&lt;/a&gt; deep into the Barents Sea – near the home of Russia’s Northern Fleet and key nuclear submarine base. And, like Russia, NATO too is investing in rebuilding and updating military infrastructures in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But security in the Arctic is about more than naval presence and counting submarines. Military and economic objectives are becoming increasingly intertwined as the thawing Arctic’s geostrategic importance grows and competing powers scramble to seize its resources and benefit from new commercial trade routes. As European NATO members grow their military presence in the Arctic and try to bolster their geostrategic heft in the region, they must also become more strategic about growing their wider economic footprint. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Presence equals sovereignty&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The EU’s self-sufficiency and independence from Russia and China will begin in the [Arctic] mine’, &lt;a href="https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/europes-largest-deposit-rare-earth-metals-found-northern-sweden"&gt;said Sweden’s then-energy minister&lt;/a&gt; Ebba Busch in 2023, while hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in the Arctic town of Kiruna – home to Europe’s &lt;a href="https://lkab.com/en/press/europes-largest-deposit-of-rare-earth-metals-is-located-in-the-kiruna-area/"&gt;largest known deposit of iron ore&lt;/a&gt; as well as significant rare earth supplies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arctic may well hold part of the answer to Europe’s quest to reduce its external resource dependencies. But Europe has so far been slow to develop these opportunities and investment has been lagging. While some of this hesitation reflects extremely valid concerns – exploiting the Arctic must not come at an environmental cost or undermine indigenous rights – it has helped open the door to actors with fewer scruples, such as China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-center embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;China has used research collaboration – including with European countries – and &lt;/span&gt;investments &lt;span&gt;in things like Arctic research stations and &lt;/span&gt;space &lt;span&gt;infrastructure to add credibility to its claim that it is a near-Arctic power.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is not just about economic opportunity costs: in the sparsely populated Arctic, physical presence equals control and sovereignty. This also carries serious security risks. Infrastructure roll-out in the Arctic is by virtue almost always dual-use, which allows the countries that own these assets to also increase their security position in this highly strategic region.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has used research collaboration – including with European countries – and &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA1200/RRA1282-1-v2/RAND_RRA1282-1-v2.pdf"&gt;investments &lt;/a&gt;in things like Arctic research stations and &lt;a href="https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/no.291_RoyrgN5.pdf"&gt;space infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; to add credibility to its claim that it is a near-Arctic power (despite its most northernmost provincial capital, Harbin, being as far from the Arctic as Venice). European countries have only recently woken up to not just the geopolitical influence that such arrangements can afford Beijing – but also their security implications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A polar silk road&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another such example is the development of the Northern Sea Route (NSR), connecting Asia and Europe by way of Russia. As the thawing Arctic becomes more accessible for commercial traffic, the NSR – which could reduce shipping time by as much as half – could become a new nerve centre of global trade. While many practical hurdles remain, Russia and China are both bent on seizing the economic opportunity these new routes have to offer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current (still modest) use of the route is &lt;a href="https://www.energyintel.com/00000199-9574-d9d1-afbb-9ffc86a60000"&gt;primarily used&lt;/a&gt; for crude oil and LNG shipments from &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/russia-and-eurasia/russia" title="Russia: Current affairs and analysis"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; to China, especially since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/russia-and-eurasia/ukraine" title="Ukraine: Current affairs and analysis"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. But Beijing’s bigger and l&lt;a href="https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/china-polar-silk-road-long-game-failed-strategy/"&gt;onger-term ambition&lt;/a&gt; is centred around new shipping routes for its goods &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/company-launches-china-europe-shipping-route-global-times-says-2025-09-22/"&gt;to Europe&lt;/a&gt; – that provides Europe with leverage and the ability to have a say in how these new routes should develop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="h5 teaser__title"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trump is pushing Europe and China closer together. Europe should tread carefully&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe must use this leverage and not allow Russia to develop the NSR on its (and Beijing’s) terms. The Russian Arctic is already becoming a &lt;a href="https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/news/more-than-30-sanctioned-shadow-fleet-tankers-shuttle-north-along-norwegian-coast/433958"&gt;hotbed for shadow fleet activity&lt;/a&gt;, used to evade Western oil sanctions. Moscow’s ambition to control the NSR has also increasingly taken on a military dimension. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, the increased navigability of the NSR will present an important litmus test for how Europe wants to handle (and exploit &lt;a href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-russia-and-china-wont-go-distance-high-north"&gt;potential fractures&lt;/a&gt; in) the China–Russia partnership, as well as its own evolving security and economic relationship with &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/asia-pacific/china" title="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Greater presence also equals new targets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe is also building its own new connections to Asia. The European Commission is &lt;a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/globalconnect/pressreleases/globalconnect-joins-nordic-project-to-develop-global-arctic-fiber-cable-linking-europe-asia-and-the-us-3364567"&gt;supporting&lt;/a&gt; the scoping of a what would be the first major undersea communications cable through the Arctic, connecting Europe to North America and East Asia. This could reduce internet traffic travel time by as much &lt;a href="https://nordu.net/a-vision-for-two-arctic-subsea-cables/"&gt;as 40 per cent&lt;/a&gt; compared to the currently dominant – but much longer and increasingly insecure – Red Sea cable routes. The project is intended to bring more diversity and security to Europe’s communications links and help Europe bolster its presence in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highly ambitious project is a good example of how security and economic concerns intersect. The cable would have a significant dual-use utility and could help bring high-speed, high-capacity connectivity to power NATO’s military infrastructure and space-based assets in the High North. It would however also create another target for possible attacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/when-it-comes-arctic-security-europe-must-not-forget-about-economics</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 11:33:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Top 10 Books: International Women’s Day 2025</title><link>https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-10-books-international-womens-day-2025-ec9c153f4c0d?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</link><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g2qFnA7t29K-y2TMYHjKbQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mark International Women’s Day this year, the official celebratory website asks us to ‘Imagine a gender equal world … A world where difference is valued and celebrated.’ This might feel like an arduous, if not utopian, demand on creativity, in a world where the far right is on the rise and women’s rights are increasingly encroached upon. For anyone in need of inspiration, Book Reviews Editor Mariana Vieira has curated a selection of outstanding books written by women that have been reviewed in the journal over the past year. As will become apparent to those who read further, this list is also partly a celebration of the women of &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Affairs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who have contributed to our diverse research offering over the years.

Published in Cambridge by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabel Bramsen’s 2022 &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/98/3/933/6553579"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;International Affairs&lt;/em&gt; drew on peace talks in the Philippines to argue that diplomatic meetings can generate social bonds between conflicting parties. In her latest book, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;micro-sociology of peace and conflict&lt;/em&gt;, Bramsen has expanded on the scope of the article’s insights, engaging with ‘micro-moments’ from the peace talks in the Philippines and Northern Ireland, to the everyday interactions at West Bank checkpoints and the reciprocal violence of the Arab Spring uprisings. Armed with an auspicious theoretical framework and a focus on video footage analysis, the author showcases how the micro-dynamics of different interactions can (de-)energize participants and lead to varying degrees of bonding or tension, which ultimately exemplify the relevance of micro-sociological approaches in IR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae186"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The women of the far right&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dtMcUybM1zfslkp1R7mF6Q.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Eviane Leidig. Published in New York by Columbia University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Cynthia Enloe was to delve into the literature on far-right radicalization and ask: ‘Where are the women?’, Eviane Leidig’s book would provide the answer. &lt;em&gt;The women of the far right &lt;/em&gt;presents a multifaceted analysis of north American ‘influencers’ and the online spaces they occupy and instrumentalize. Leidig details how these women have sought to make far-right movements relatable and to generate socio-political acceptance of their ideologies. The book offers many new insights, exploring how these influencers were radicalized themselves, shedding light on the business and lifestyle dimensions of their online radicalization activities and contextualizing their impact within wider transnational networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae242"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Inside the UN Security Council&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6tyPeFdqeRLld25dLV_7gg.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Jess Gifkins. Published in Oxford by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The war in Darfur, Sudan, lasted almost three decades and many have asked what international society could have done differently. &lt;em&gt;Inside the UN Security Council&lt;/em&gt; critically appraises how the UNSC’s decision-making processes and questions of legitimacy dictated its approach to the conflict in Darfur. Jess Gifkins, who has previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiad177"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;International Affairs&lt;/em&gt; on the importance of queering the Responsibility to Protect doctrine, turns here to the importance of informal, unwritten legitimation practices within the UNSC. The book will appeal to a wide audience, as it illustrates the previously underplayed role of the ten non-permanent members, challenges rational models that overlook when actors choose to take action for optics and points to the implications of China’s increasing influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae257"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Autocracy, Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bLPz4r3UUsgevJ1YF9JmeQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Anne Applebaum. Published in London by Allen Lane.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Applebaum’s latest book indicts both the autocratic leaders with global ambitions and the western politicians and kleptocrats that enable and profit from the activities of the former. &lt;em&gt;Autocracy, Inc.&lt;/em&gt; combines a fascinating account of how the autocrat’s involvement in sanctions-busting, arms trade and drug-dealing, combined with an eye-opening description of the ways in which a host of western banks, lawyers, real-estate agents and media sympathizers have lined their pockets with the profits from money-laundering activities. While Applebaum rounds off the book with suggestions for financial regulations and ‘de-risking’, readers are not advised to skip ahead, as this well-researched wake-up call should be thoroughly digested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf026"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The uncertainty doctrine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9B4EDKTS9_OMJ9tR5Oo7kQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Alexandra Homolar. Published in Cambridge by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this fresh and ambitious take on the role of narratives in US foreign policy, Alexandra Homolar questions why the end of the Cold War brought about many changes to the international arena but spelled continuity for US security strategy. The author yields her archive-based chapters impressively to demonstrate the messiness of narratives, despite IR scholars’ wishes and efforts to impose order on them. Resorting to illustrative metaphors, the book demonstrates how US foreign policy elites built a post-Cold War security narrative through a process of entanglement and negotiation, as opposed to developing a masterminded vision.

Published in Oxford by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connoisseurs of Kira Huju’s 2022 &lt;em&gt;International Affairs&lt;/em&gt; article, ‘&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiab220"&gt;Saffronizing diplomacy: the Indian Foreign Service under Hindu nationalist rule&lt;/a&gt;’, will find Huju’s first book eminently rewarding. In &lt;em&gt;Cosmopolitan elites&lt;/em&gt;, Huju picks up the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) once again, to expose how class, caste, gender and religion shape its composition. The author brings in everyday practices and domestic hierarchies to illustrate the exclusionary codes that dictate participation in international society. The book benefits from a broad historical scope that allows Huju to document the enduring tension between the influence of colonial ideals and the aspirations of a postcolonial India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae188"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;PeaceTech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yRkCEQGECrHM9b8xE-Ea6A.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Christine Bell. Published in Cham, Switzerland by Springer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this open-access and timely book, Christine Bell re-energizes the debate on how emerging technologies can be deployed in conflict and peacebuilding settings. Bell warns against the appeal of ‘shiny new things’ and questions the assumption that digital innovation can automatically improve peacebuilding practices. The author explores the drivers behind the agendas and investment decisions that shape peacebuilding endeavours. Equally candid and inspirational, the book puts forward a twelve-step manifesto on ensuring that digital tools support peace processes. As a long-time practitioner and scholar, Bell is well placed to provide insights that will benefit anyone interested in the digitization of contemporary dynamics of peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf047"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Governing the feminist peace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GRRJr6AyRFFAi4nTLPIWDA.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Paul Kirby and Laura J. Shepherd. Published in New York by Columbia University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its brilliantly illustrated cover, this co-authored book has a much wider appeal. Paul Kirby and Laura Shepherd have teamed up for a provocative and convincing critique of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, as a product of specific global governance frameworks. Deploying some impressive empirical research, &lt;em&gt;Governing the feminist peace&lt;/em&gt; persuasively highlights the incoherent, contested and contingent nature of the WPS discourse, particularly as it features in the fields of policy and governance. In the words of our reviewer: ‘forgetting WPS, in the way that Kirby and Shepherd suggest, might provide an opportunity to expand the ethical imaginaries of war and peace’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae203"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Reluctance in world politics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Sandra Destradi.

Wajner and Michael Zürn. As a multifaceted scholar, Destradi’s most recent book before that sought to explain why powerful states fail to act decisively in the face of crises within their spheres of influence. To explain this phenomenon, the author offers a new and multidimensional theory of reluctance that breaks with the idea that ‘reluctant hegemons’ are unwilling to lead. Destradi compares the case-studies of Brazil, Germany and India, illustrating their policy choices through an impressive combination of expert interviews and policy analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae214"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Police peacekeeping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Lou Pingeot.

This impressive feat of ethnographic and interdisciplinary research traces the emergence of peacebuilding and global policing, offering a stark reminder of their colonial histories: policing models designed to pacify the populations deemed as a risk to social orders are deployed abroad with important implications for the global social order. In the words of our reviewer, this book is ‘essential reading for those researching and developing policy guidance for peacekeeping, military and humanitarian interventions, as well as for those interested in the reproduction of global inequalities’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae258"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mariana Vieira is the Book Reviews Editor of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;International Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find the latest book reviews section in our March 2025 issue &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/issue/101/2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more reading suggestions, check out the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/tagged/ia-bookshelf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IA Bookshelf series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are interested in reviewing a book for the journal, register your interest in our book review application form &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6ZOiHKZ2WYj8UEaaXy9-gVuv_0ONmB2x2pv1x9-VcSWwCdg/viewform"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and follow us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IAJournal_CH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;social media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; where we post regular call outs for specific books and experts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All views expressed are individual not institutional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=ec9c153f4c0d" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-10-books-international-womens-day-2025-ec9c153f4c0d"&gt;Top 10 Books: International Women’s Day 2025&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog"&gt;International Affairs Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-10-books-international-womens-day-2025-ec9c153f4c0d?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 16:09:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Top 10 books: The International Affairs Christmas reading list 2024</title><link>https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-10-books-the-international-affairs-christmas-reading-list-b01a06458d70?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</link><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g2qFnA7t29K-y2TMYHjKbQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The holidays offer the perfect excuse to read a book from cover to cover and our Christmas reading list has excellent suggestions for the international relations enthusiast. This year, Book Reviews Editor Mariana Vieira was inspired by the regional spread of the books reviewed for the journal and this hand-picked selection spotlights a wide range of locales, from Australia, Cuba, Egypt and Haiti, to India, Iran, Tanzania and Uganda. And because diversity is not simply a matter of geography, the books featured also vary thematically, speaking to issues of defence, interventionism, gender, postcolonial imaginations and more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) The unfinished quest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jKOEVJ4yFn5XNBnJS0EBew.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by T.V. Paul. Published in New York by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The unfinished quest&lt;/em&gt;, T.V. Paul examines India’s pursuit of great power status since it gained its independence in 1947. The book combines a historical view of origins, causes and drivers with an assessment of the country’s hard and soft power capabilities, including its domestic and international practices. Paul points to how the gap between India’s status ambitions and its material capabilities to achieve them is closing. Despite its promising progress, Paul contends that India must address certain human development challenges before it can achieve the greater recognition that it seeks.

Gerges. Published in New Haven, CT by Yale University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of regional and distinguished veterans with a regional expertise, Fawaz A. Gerges’s latest book spotlights the West’s destabilizing role in the Middle East. The author argues that US interventions at the height of the Cold War largely contributed to the regional ‘failure of democracy’. The book features case-studies of Iran and Egypt, exploring the CIA’s toppling of Iran’s elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953 and the US’ alienation of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Gerges’s useful and tactful counterfactual approach to the ‘seeds of instability’ prompts readers to reflect on the political trajectories of both countries and on the realm of possibilities that western interventionism foreclosed in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae252"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Intervention before interventionism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Au3EPW10rxc3OwvybIboSg.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Patrick Quinton-Brown. Published in Oxford by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this feat of genealogical prowess, Singapore-based Patrick Quinton-Brown traces and problematizes the origins and development of the concept of intervention in international relations. Drawing on a wealth of archival research, the book navigates the post-1945 debates on interventionism, sovereignty and self-determination, displacing the mainstream Westphalian discourses and recovering the global South perspectives and contributions. Our Review Forum on &lt;em&gt;Intervention before interventionism&lt;/em&gt; offers an instructive, careful and inspiring dialogue on the book’s aims to lay out ‘a series of alternatives at a time when non-intervention, quite suddenly, seems everywhere’.

Published in Stanford, CA by Stanford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While existing research focuses largely on the Soviet–Cuban bilateral ties, &lt;em&gt;Our comrades in Havana&lt;/em&gt; reveals the ‘complex and often adversarial relationship between the various actors’ without losing sight of Cuba’s agency and its international activism. Radoslav Yordanov foregrounds Cuba’s relationships with the Soviet bloc through a series of chronological events, including Cuba’s formal entrance and subsequent economic dependence on the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Yordanov’s dedication to recently declassified records from eastern European states allows the author to detail developments such as Cuba’s disappointment with the lack of support for its active role in the Third World and East Germany’s contributions to Cuba’s intelligence capabilities. This book broadens the horizons of Cold War historiography and whets the appetite of global history enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae260"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) The face of the nation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ODaMoiZqqtTLW7NxSQx8JA.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Elise Stephenson.

In it, Elise Stephenson, the deputy director of the Global Institute for Women’s Leadership, focuses on different institutions and pays special attention to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). While women’s representation within the DFAT has increased, the institution is shrinking in power and funding as other defence agencies are expanding. The book’s dozens of interviews with women in senior positions, including Australia’s first female prime minister, Julia Gillard, will also benefit anyone interested in diplomacy and women’s experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae189"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) NATO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fnQR0rfDsNoF_z_yXD-3Ug.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Sten Rynning.

In the forum, four experts examine Rynning’s accessible history of the alliance, the author’s understanding of the most suitable role for NATO and his policy recommendations to ensure NATO remains at its best (in its classic Europe-focused format). The book does an excellent job of emphasizing the cyclical nature of NATO’s existence, from crisis to opportunities, and Rynning usefully navigates the current challenges that the alliance faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the Review Forum &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae150"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Wealth, power, and authoritarian institutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OSuO8nSG5WE9OyslEaeAXw.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Michaela Collord. Published in Oxford by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her debut monograph, Michaela Collord develops a convincing comparison of how ruling elites, particularly party leaders, have accumulated and invested wealth with institutional repercussions for parliaments in Uganda and Tanzania. &lt;em&gt;Wealth, power, and authoritarian institutions&lt;/em&gt; draws contrasts between the neighbouring countries, showcasing how centralized resource accumulation has hindered legislative autonomy in Tanzania and how elite enrichment has made it almost impossible to instil party discipline in Uganda. Collord offers a persuasive account of east African politics and the key individuals that, through loyalty and prestige, have successfully leveraged elite factional rivalries within their respective parliaments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae241"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) Post-imperial possibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tok-KvY26AMCEWngJHsChw.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Jane Burbank and Frederick Cooper.

However, if you are not acquainted with their ground-breaking 2010 work &lt;em&gt;Empires in world history&lt;/em&gt;, do yourself a favour: pick it up and quickly follow up with &lt;em&gt;Post-imperial possibilities&lt;/em&gt;. Burbank and Cooper are back (and better than ever) with this exploration of three hypothetical world visions that emerged in the global South during the wave of decolonization. The book investigates the origins, premises and merits of ideas of Eurafrica, Eurasia and Afroasia as future possibilities at a time of hopeful, rapid and drastic change. The book straddles both mid-twentieth-century history and more recent developments, questioning the inevitability of the nation-state model of statehood.

Leidig details how these women have sought to make far-right movements relatable and to generate socio-political acceptance of their ideologies. The book offers many new insights, exploring how these influencers were radicalized themselves, shedding light on the business and lifestyle dimensions of their online radicalization activities and contextualizing their impact within wider transnational networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae242"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) Police peacekeeping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0b7K17oF-LRyBxv9LgYbFg.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Lou Pingeot.

However, analysing Trump during the 2024 campaign, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/politics/trump-speeches-age-cognitive-decline.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; have sounded alarm bells about his mental state and what that might mean for his leadership. Such speculation as to what might be different about a Trump 2.0 administration, and about Trump himself, begs the question: do leaders ever really change?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do leaders ever change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research in psychology supports the idea that leaders have stable personalities. This is because their general world-views, characteristics and motivations stem from their socio-cultural backgrounds and genetic factors, which do not change over time. This has been a long-held and broadly supported view in both psychology and the subfield of political psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some research challenges the notion that leaders are set in their ways. For example, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5964/ps.6009"&gt;modern personality research&lt;/a&gt; highlights how humans undergo personality changes during periods of transition. Studies have also shown that &lt;a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcs.1539?casa_token=85SAnfWPfGkAAAAA%3Afd3NcXN8Q3vo1G7CuSdvBtVDMXT4cs62tgpHajvNjd35qSN-EreXIzTVFijBgxVpQee_2cIqMgr4cHo"&gt;belief systems are more pliable&lt;/a&gt; than once thought, and that leaders can experience &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaa221"&gt;significant changes&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, power itself alters us, even &lt;a href="https://www.oveo.org/fichiers/power-changes-how-the-brain-responds-to-others.pdf"&gt;neurologically&lt;/a&gt;, often generating more &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044153"&gt;self-confidence, self-entitlement and self-serving behaviours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has Trump changed since 2016?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what about Trump? Were four years of presidency enough to change him? Consistent with the ‘people are stable’ view, we would not expect Trump’s second term to be dramatically different to his first. Indeed, some of the traits that Trump displayed in his first presidency, such as his &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09557571.2021.1879018"&gt;intense distrust of others&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/96/2/383/5722298"&gt;ultra-sensitivity to criticism, in addition to his tendency to challenge or ignore norms&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/99/2/605/7069031"&gt;transactional and ‘America First’ world-views&lt;/a&gt;, continue to reflect in his words and actions today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, key developments could have changed Trump. For one, Trump is not as politically inexperienced as he was when he first took office. Thus, there is a possibility that he may be even less likely to listen to advice this time around. Furthermore, at 78, Trump may be experiencing age-related changes, perhaps thinking in short time horizons, &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/45293419"&gt;reflecting on mortality&lt;/a&gt;, or experiencing the psychological effects of age-related medical conditions. While old age does not affect all people in the same way, we might expect cognitive decline, heightened emotionality and an increased focus on legacy, which could lead to more risk-taking and authoritarian practices. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/trump-greenland-canada-history.html"&gt;Trump 2.0’s references to ‘manifest destiny’ and his threats to take Greenland&lt;/a&gt; may stem from a motivation to leave a legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way Trump might have changed is in learning what did and didn’t work during his first term. For example, Trump seems to have concluded that loyalty, as a quality in his advisers, should be the predominant criterion for his appointments. We clearly see this in his new &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/podcasts/the-daily/trump-cabinet.html"&gt;cabinet choices &lt;/a&gt;which have been shaped more by candidates’ devotion to Trump than by their having suitable experience for the positions, and also in the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/02/03/what-is-elon-musks-role-exactly-white-house-calls-him-special-government-employee-heres-what-that-means/"&gt;exceptional informal power Trump has granted Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, in his first term Trump learned the constraints that bureaucracy can place on presidents. These limitations were highly incongruent with Trump’s previous experience as a CEO where he had much more autonomy. As a result, Trump learned to assert &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/"&gt;greater control over non-political appointees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/donald-trumps-plan-to-make-the-presidency-more-like-a-kingship"&gt;independent agencies&lt;/a&gt;. Such centralization of authority and decision-making may intensify to avoid the frustration he experienced in his first term. We already see this in Trump’s attempts to reshape the federal bureaucracy, which have included &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjdmx12j9no"&gt;threats to close agencies, such as USAID.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, dramatic events in the first Trump administration and the inter-term period may have triggered key changes in Trump. The first impeachment trial, for example, reportedly infuriated him, affecting both his &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/podcasts/the-daily/second-trump-presidency.html?searchResultPosition=3"&gt;view of a ‘deep state’&lt;/a&gt; within his administration and his &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/99/2/605/7069031?searchresult=1"&gt;orientation toward Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. His defeat in the 2020 election, and his inability to overturn the election results, only strengthened this vengeance motive against those who he feels wronged him. For example, in the early days of his second presidency, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/01/trump-purge-at-justice-department-of-january-6-prosecutors-and-threat-to-fbi-agents"&gt;fired Justice Department personnel who were involved in January 6 investigations&lt;/a&gt; and also&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/23/mike-pompeo-brian-hook-john-bolton-security"&gt; revoked federal protection for his former advisers-turned-critics&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, Trump’s success in 2024 (and his survival of two assassination attempts) may have created a strong feeling of invincibility and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/132/5/1396/354862?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;hubris syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Trump’s bold self-confidence is evident early in his second term, and can be seen in his numerous, sweeping &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/"&gt;extraordinary tariffs levelled against economic allies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/donald-trump-vs-the-world-plus-are-china-and/id1744345702?i=1000687499670"&gt;bullying of Panama and Colombia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A heightened version of the same Trump?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiences of his first presidency, changes triggered by age and key events have not generated an entirely new Trump; rather, they have reinforced his existing beliefs, characteristics and motivations. So, what we likely have now is a more extreme and experienced version of Trump 1.0. He may have always been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/podcasts/the-daily/trump-revenge.html"&gt;vindictive&lt;/a&gt; towards those he perceived as threatening, but now he has more targets and deeper knowledge of how to use the powers of presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether any changes in Trump’s character will affect his policy-making and governance partly depends on where he focuses his efforts. As in his first term, Trump may be &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09557571.2021.1879018"&gt;predictably unpredictable&lt;/a&gt; regarding which policy areas and political actors attract his attention. But what we do know is that Trump 2.0 has come to office with a clearer focus on strengthening his powers and surrounding himself with like-minded people — these are the key differences thus far. How Trump interprets and builds on his experience in his second term can further alter (and reinforce) who he is, with significant consequences for the US and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juliet Kaarbo, Professor of Foreign Policy, University of St Andrews, Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more about this topic in the full article ‘&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaa221"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New directions for leader personality research: breaking bad in foreign policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;’, published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;International Affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=b0c660da1858" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/has-trump-changed-b0c660da1858"&gt;Has Trump Changed?&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog"&gt;International Affairs Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/has-trump-changed-b0c660da1858?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 15:42:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s policies and actions pose serious risks to corporate America</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/09/trumps-policies-and-actions-pose-serious-risks-corporate-america</link><description>&lt;span&gt;Trump’s policies and actions pose serious risks to corporate America    &lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;US democratic backsliding and diminished support for global norms may undermine investor confidence in the US and affect the ability of American companies to do business abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, American business has relied on the relative stability and predictability of the nation’s governance – despite the turbulence of domestic politics – and on US support for the institutions and norms underpinning the rules-based international order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That stability is now being upended by the policies and actions of the Trump administration. This not only poses severe challenges to the &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/americas/united-states-america" title="United States of America"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, international security and global economy but also to US multinational corporations and institutional investors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="h5 teaser__title"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The biggest economic risk from Donald Trump’s presidency is a loss of confidence in US governance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s economic policies, including much higher and deeply uncertain trade tariffs, are beginning to undermine confidence in the US as a financial ‘safe haven’. An inward-looking, protectionist US is not in the long-term interest of American companies, investors, consumers or workers – nor is a global order in which normative rules are trumped by transactional deals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The erosion of the rule of law in the US and arbitrary use of executive power is further weakening the predictability and transparency valued by companies and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, US multinational corporations and investors are underestimating these challenges and the risks they pose to their interests. Instead of fighting to safeguard the structural bedrock of their success, most are sidestepping their responsibility. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks to corporate America and the US economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before last year’s presidential election, apprehensions were widely shared – but rarely voiced – by US business leaders. Former Merck CEO Ken Frazier &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a6eaa1ae-3456-4b82-b168-4cfdbadb0636"&gt;warned of an existential threat&lt;/a&gt; to the ‘basic norms, values and respect for the rule of law that has made the American economy what it is’ and former American Express CEO Ken Chenault cautioned that ‘&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/business-requires-stability-former-american-022356029.html"&gt;business requires stability&lt;/a&gt;’. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But uncertainty over the election outcome – and anxiety over retribution after a Trump victory – &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/16a30bcf-255c-4548-bcc2-db9efb59eede"&gt;prevented&lt;/a&gt; corporate America’s major policy organizations from speaking clearly about the stakes for business, the US and the world. The prospect of lower corporate taxation and regulation also provided tangible short-term prizes that outweighed hypothetical long-term risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the response from US business has continued to be muted even as many of those risks have crystallized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, the direction towards &lt;a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/08/us-democratic-backsliding-in-comparative-perspective?lang=en"&gt;democratic backsliding&lt;/a&gt; is consistent. Abroad, the direction of the US government has been consistently ‘America First’ in tone but unpredictable in substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest damage to American multinationals has been the crippling of US engagement in the international community, its diplomatic capacity and soft power with the elimination of USAID and the restructuring of the State Department. The weakening of US support for multilateral institutions and agreements complicates the ability of American multinationals to follow standards and regulations across different jurisdictions. Meanwhile, the elimination of most humanitarian and development assistance programs may heighten risks of instability and conflict in many countries and regions where American and other multinationals operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the degradation of initiatives to counter corruption and to protect labour and human rights undermines responsible business conduct that remains essential to business stability. As a result, US companies may become more exposed to legal challenges, operational disruptions and brand boycotts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fear of speaking out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate America is currently in no mood to openly challenge the Trump administration, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/inside-the-room-where-ceos-say-what-they-really-think-of-trumps-policies-cfb69e22"&gt;despite private worries&lt;/a&gt; over ‘state capitalism’, pressure on the Fed, high new tariffs and restrictions on immigration. Indeed, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/464a1ad9-d1b7-44b8-b470-13ea9b64e677"&gt;American CEOs are unlikely&lt;/a&gt; to spark an anti-Trump rebellion anytime soon, especially with the intimidation and implied threat of retribution posed by the reported White House &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/15/white-house-rating-big-beautiful-bill"&gt;’loyalty rating’&lt;/a&gt; of over 500 companies and trade associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate America’s primary public policy organization of CEOs, the Business Roundtable, remains very cautious. While it made a careful &lt;a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-welcomes-progress-on-trade-deals-calls-for-lower-tariffs"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; welcoming trade deals to lower tariffs – along with the National Association of Manufacturers and the US Chamber of Commerce – it has otherwise refrained from the kind of critical and/or constructive statements that were common during previous administrations of both parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, neither such organizations nor the broader US business community – most conspicuously the tech industry – have spoken out or acted to counter trends that may further corrode the pillars of the US and global economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some individual business leaders are beginning to speak out, including major US investors like Bridgewater hedge fund founder &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b86bd33b-b3e7-4485-8b1c-6f01e639dd04"&gt;Ray Dalio&lt;/a&gt;.

In June, the American Bar Association (ABA) &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/16/american-bar-association-sues-trump-00409204"&gt;sued the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; over the executive orders targeting law firms. In September, the ad hoc bipartisan group (of prominent legal scholars, public servants and literary figures) &lt;a href="https://weholdtruths.org/"&gt;We Hold These Truths&lt;/a&gt; took out ads in major media outlets supporting personal freedoms, separation of powers, the rule of law, equality, democracy and elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A realistic and responsible approach for business&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these actions, though significant, are insufficient. Despite their concerns, US multinationals and investors can and should go further to protect their interests and the core values that are currently under threat.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/09/trumps-policies-and-actions-pose-serious-risks-corporate-america</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 10:21:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What feminism can do for cybersecurity</title><link>https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/what-feminism-can-do-for-cybersecurity-486035bc7d5a?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</link><description>&lt;h4&gt;Anwar Mhajne and Crystal Whetstone show why cybersecurity needs to be understood from a feminist lens.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0mxGMOaeY3EDXy8o4zZWLQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A woman walks past a tech fair during the CyberSec 2024 in Taipei on 14 May 2024.

However, viewing cybersecurity as such masks its implications for human rights and human security. For instance, not only do democratic and non-democratic governments exploit this conception of cybersecurity to justify espionage, censorship, surveillance and disinformation, but they may also label criticism as ‘fake news’ and pressure businesses for access to personal data to verify it. In this context, some scholars question the utility of the term ‘cybersecurity’ itself, believing it may perpetuate militarized policies. Others suggest adopting a ‘&lt;a href="https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/what-can-a-critical-cybersecurity-do"&gt;pluriversal cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;’ to encompass diverse perspectives beyond state and corporate security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blogpost, we build on our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae234"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Affairs &lt;/em&gt;article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make the case for understanding cybersecurity from a feminist perspective. A feminist lens would help emphasize security’s multifaceted nature and provide interdisciplinary ways of thinking about cyber(in)security and violence. We show how this can be achieved by incorporating insights from feminist security studies (FSS) that can help decentre the state, shift the focus to human rights protections in cyberspace and interrogate who is served by traditional cybersecurity approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What feminism can bring to cybersecurity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780429453458/global-gender-politics-anne-sisson-runyan"&gt;Anne Runyan’s &lt;/a&gt;gendered lens to develop a more comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity. This approach uses intersectionality to explore how gender, race, class and sexuality collectively influence people’s experiences under dynamic power structures and oppressions. It provides crucial insights into the everyday experiences of cyber violence, ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.unfpa.org/TFGBV"&gt;technology-facilitated gender-based violence&lt;/a&gt; (TF-GBV) and attacks on critical infrastructure to cyberharassment, all of which more significantly affect people from marginalized backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae234"&gt;A feminist cybersecurity: addressing the crisis of cyber(in)security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FSS scholars contend that security extends beyond nation-states. Rather, they expand the mainstream notion of cybersecurity by focusing on the security of ordinary individuals. This approach captures many vulnerabilities that are often overlooked in traditional discussions on cybersecurity. For example, cyberharassment, particularly TF-GBV, impacts &lt;a href="https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2023-04/Technology-facilitated-violence-against-women-Taking-stock-of-evidence-and-data-collection-en.pdf"&gt;women, children, and gender diverse and queer people&lt;/a&gt; and those from &lt;a href="https://glitchcharity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glitch-Misogynoir-Report_Final_18Jul_v5_Single-Pages.pdf"&gt;marginalized backgrounds&lt;/a&gt; to a greater degree than it impacts men and other hegemonic groups due to racialization and their status as minorities. Yet, most governments and traditional security actors do not pay enough attention to this violence, given their limited focus on state security, as seen in the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf"&gt;US government’s&lt;/a&gt; national cybersecurity strategy and &lt;a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;’s cyber defence policy. Ultimately, FSS challenges this by advocating for a more inclusive understanding that accounts for the diverse and everyday cyber insecurities faced by people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How a feminist cybersecurity can be achieved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feminist studies scholars recommend democratizing the theory and practice of cybersecurity. They encourage acknowledging the agency of those who directly experience cyber insecurities and actively involving them in matters of peace and security without relying on militarization. For example, instead of promoting a state-centred, top-down approach to designing frameworks to ‘secure’ cyberspace, international legislation could incorporate a gendered lens that engages civil society. Such efforts can address cyber-based human rights violations while avoiding a damaging cyber arms race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend establishing a cybersecurity treaty for the protection of civil liberties and rights for all, informed by marginalized groups such as queer communities and those from the global South. Such a framework must avoid being co-opted by powerful nations and must be a participatory process that includes grassroots collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initiatives in which the voices of marginalized communities are prioritized have proved effective in the past. For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.nti.org/education-center/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/"&gt;Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons&lt;/a&gt; saw great participation by those in non-nuclear states and civil society, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the involvement of the global South and civil society in crafting solid protections. A bottom-up approach could create an inclusive cybersecurity standard, moving beyond a protector/protected binary centred only on looking after users in the West and fostering genuine global cooperation in safeguarding online civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building cybersecurity from a feminist perspective involves ensuring access to cyberspace with human rights protections for all, which can be achieved through demilitarization that addresses the unique insecurities of different groups. A feminist cybersecurity framework emphasizes the rights of marginalized communities by acknowledging harms caused by disinformation, cyberbullying, suppression and TF-GBV. An FSS approach reveals often unseen violence through intersectionality and a broader understanding of security. While insecurities in the cyber(in)security crisis cannot be fully eliminated, they can be reduced by everyday individuals working to democratize cybersecurity practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more about this topic in the full article &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae234"&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A feminist cybersecurity: addressing the crisis of cyber(in)security’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was published in the November issue of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;International Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae234"&gt;A feminist cybersecurity: addressing the crisis of cyber(in)security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anwar Mhajne is an Associate Professor of Political Science and International Studies at Stonehill College, US.

  &lt;p&gt;New Delhi has announced the reopening of its embassy in Afghanistan amid a sharp deterioration in relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class="media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image"&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="S. Jaishankar and Amir Khan Muttaqi" height="630" src="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2025-10/2025-10-15-afghanistan-taliban-muttaqi-india-jaishankar-2239678021.jpg?itok=pjwy0ey1" width="1200" /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Afghan Foreign Minister Amit Khan Muttaqi visited India last week, making him the most senior Taliban official to visit the country since the group re-seized power in Afghanistan in 2021. During the visit, the Indian government &lt;a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/40191/EAMs_opening_remarks_during_meeting_with_Foreign_Minister_of_Afghanistan_October_10_2025"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to the status of an embassy, which it had shut four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These developments are part of New Delhi’s efforts to reset its relations with the Taliban and mark a notable shift in the region’s geopolitics. Historically, India has viewed the Taliban with hostility, given the group’s extremist ideology and its close affiliation with the Pakistani military and intelligence establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India supported the Northern Alliance against the Taliban during the 1996-2001 Afghan Civil War. India was then a close partner of the Western-backed government that assumed power following the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. In response, the Taliban and its proxies carried out attacks on Indian nationals in Afghanistan, including on the Indian embassy in Kabul &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20091008-taliban-claims-responsibility-attack-outside-indian-embassy-?tpcc=south_asia_brief&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=South%20Asia%20Brief%2001152025&amp;amp;utm_term=south_asia_brief"&gt;in 2009&lt;/a&gt; and the Indian consulate in Herat &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27533268"&gt;in 2014.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the Taliban’s seizure of power in 2021, India closed its embassy in Afghanistan and has not formally recognized the group as the official government. However, India reopened its technical mission in Kabul in 2022 and remained engaged with Afghanistan through humanitarian assistance, including providing aid following the earthquake in August. In November last year, the Taliban appointed an envoy in New Delhi and an acting consul general for its mission in Mumbai. The next month, Muttaqi met Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri for &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/india-holds-highest-level-talks-with-taliban-over-security-concerns-trade-and-aid/ar-BB1r9xbM?ocid=BingNewsSerp"&gt;talks in Dubai.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The enemy of my enemy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indian government’s shift to engaging with the Taliban is motivated by several factors. Primarily, New Delhi wants to prevent Afghanistan from re-emerging as a hub for militancy and terrorism that threatens India’s security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taliban represents a ‘lesser evil’ compared to groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The Taliban has &lt;a href="https://x.com/ANI/status/1976544524630450481"&gt;reassured India&lt;/a&gt; that it ‘will not allow any group to use our territory against others.’ Kabul also condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rapprochement coincides with a downturn in relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Islamabad has historically had close relations with the Taliban. But while Islamabad once viewed Afghanistan as a source of &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09700161.2019.1625512"&gt;‘strategic depth’&lt;/a&gt; in its rivalry with India, it now increasingly views its north-western neighbour as a liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muttaqi’s visit to India coincided with &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b4444ac4-9c9e-4928-a971-ca46e94cf9d7"&gt;cross-border clashes&lt;/a&gt; between Afghan and Pakistani forces that &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/new-normal-is-pakistan-trying-to-set-new-red-lines-with-afghan-taliban"&gt;reportedly left dozens dead.&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan accuses the Afghan Taliban of hosting the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP or Pakistani Taliban), a conglomerate of several insurgent groups that aims to overthrow the Pakistani state.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TTP has &lt;a href="https://satp.org/terrorism-assessment/pakistan-khyberpakhtunkhwa"&gt;stepped up its attacks&lt;/a&gt; inside Pakistan since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Islamabad also &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghanistan-pakistan-is-latest-conflict-trump-wants-solve-why-has-it-erupted-2025-10-13/"&gt;accuses India&lt;/a&gt; of stoking these tensions, allegations which &lt;a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-blames-indian-proxies-afghanistan-for-terror-attacks-as-talibans-muttaqi-meets-jaishankar-101760151107417.html"&gt;it denies.&lt;/a&gt; These tensions are rooted in the disputed status of the 2,600km Durand Line that delineates the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diplomacy and development&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Taliban, outreach to India signals an effort to break free of its diplomatic isolation and strengthen its legitimacy. It follows &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c78n4wely9do"&gt;Russia’s decision&lt;/a&gt; in July to re-establish diplomatic relations with the Taliban, making it the first (and so far only) government to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taliban also wants India to re-emerge as an important development partner for Afghanistan. It is particularly keen on securing economic assistance as Western donor support has declined since the Taliban took over following NATO’s withdrawal in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India was a major development partner for the previous Afghan government and supported several projects in the country. During a joint press conference with his Afghan counterpart, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar &lt;a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/40191/EAMs_opening_remarks_during_meeting_with_Foreign_Minister_of_Afghanistan_October_10_2025"&gt;noted that&lt;/a&gt; India would maintain and repair completed projects in Afghanistan, as well committing to six new projects in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The Taliban also wants India to re-emerge as an important development partner for Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaishankar also stated that India ‘deeply appreciated’ the invitation for ‘Indian companies to explore mining opportunities in Afghanistan’. Development assistance in the form of medical and food support and water resource management was also discussed during Muttaqi’s visit. Other topics included the potential for additional flights between New Delhi and Kabul, education and capacity building programmes, and expediting visas for Afghan nationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India also seeks to bolster its regional connectivity. It already relies on the Chabahar port in Iran for trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia. Improving relations with Kabul could lead to a further increase in trade between the two countries via this route, particularly after the closure of the Atari-Wagah border between India and Pakistan following hostilities between them in April-May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limits of rapprochement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these moves, there remain limits to the rapprochement. The reopening of the Indian embassy in Kabul does not equate to the formal re-establishment of diplomatic relations between both countries. New Delhi remains averse to the Taliban’s extreme version of Deobandi Islam, which is shared by several groups that pursue an overtly anti-India agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gap in values between the governments of the two countries was evident in the notable absence of any female journalists during a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgqgl2dxweo"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; with Muttaqi. The decision drew the ire of Indian media and public opinion and prompted another press event where female journalists &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gze7ely6vo"&gt;were present.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taliban has clamped down on women’s rights in Afghanistan, including banning their access to education and job opportunities in the country. In July, the International Criminal Court issued &lt;a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-afghanistan-icc-pre-trial-chamber-ii-issues-arrest-warrants-haibatullah-akhundzada"&gt;arrest warrants&lt;/a&gt; for two senior Taliban leaders (Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and Chief Justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani) on charges of abuse against women and girls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/india-seeking-reset-relations-taliban-can-rapprochement-last</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 11:08:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A ‘Drone Wall’ is needed for Europe to defend against a new threat</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/drone-wall-needed-europe-defend-against-new-threat</link><description>&lt;span&gt;A ‘Drone Wall’ is needed for Europe to defend against a new threat&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The international reach of drones means that cooperation across Europe is essential to implement counter-drone measures against a hostile state or terrorist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Over the past week, a spate of incidents involving drone sightings over sensitive sites in Europe’s ‘home territories’ represents a concerning innovation of grey-zone activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copenhagen airport was &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4lj1yvgvgo?amp;at_campaign=rss"&gt;forced to close&lt;/a&gt; for several hours on 22 September, affecting 20,000 passengers. Two Royal Danish Air Force bases (Aalborg and Karup) were later disrupted by Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) sightings, closing the former site twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar incidents have been reported in Sweden (&lt;a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/suspicious-drone-spotted-over-sweden-s-karlskrona-archipelago/3699970"&gt;over the Karlskrona Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;), Norway (over &lt;a href="https://www.newsinenglish.no/2025/09/29/norwegian-airspace-violated-again/"&gt;Ørland Air Station&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4lj1yvgvgo?amp;at_campaign=rss"&gt;near Oslo Airport&lt;/a&gt;), Germany (&lt;a href="https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/wieder-drohnen-ueber-daenischen-militaerstandorten,drohnen-170.html"&gt;over Schleswig-Holstein&lt;/a&gt;), and Finland (over Valajaskoski power station’s &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/drone-spotted-near-finnish-power-090600395.html?guccounter=1"&gt;no-fly zone&lt;/a&gt;). Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen described the incursions as ‘the most severe attack on Danish infrastructure so far’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A European &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/09/26/eu-launches-drone-wall-to-detect-and-destroy"&gt;‘Drone Wall’ &lt;/a&gt;focused on detection and intervention&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘capable actor’ to which the Danish incursions have been attributed has not been formally identified, yet they have readily been described as ‘hybrid’ incidents by Danish authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href="https://ekstrabladet.dk/krimi/bekraefter-russisk-krigsskib-indgaar-i-efterforskning/10957168"&gt;Danish newspaper &lt;em&gt;Ekstra Bladet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alleges that Russian naval vessel &lt;em&gt;Aleksandr Shabalikn&lt;/em&gt; had been identified off the coast of Denmark at the time, with its Automatic Identification System (AIS) disabled. Investigative journalists have also identified links between the Russian paramilitary RSB-Group and the owner of a cargo vessel which was also suspected of playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the incursions, and at a commendably swift pace, the European Commission chaired a meeting of ten defence ministers on 26 September, and discussed the creation of a European &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/09/26/eu-launches-drone-wall-to-detect-and-destroy"&gt;‘drone wall,’ &lt;/a&gt;an anti-UAS system focused on ‘detection and intervention’, according to Andrius Kubilius, the European Commissioner for Defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These incidents are part of a wider trend of innovation in drone use. Since 2022, UAS were (arguably) employed most spectacularly during Operation SPIDERWEB by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Utilizing cheap small UAS smuggled into Russia aboard civilian trucks, guided by open-source AI systems and civilian telephone networks, &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-departments-and-programmes/russia-and-eurasia-programme/russias-war-ukraine" title="Russia’s war on Ukraine "&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; was able to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq69qnvj6nlo"&gt;wreak havoc&lt;/a&gt; against Moscow’s strategic bomber force, targeting valuable strategic areas deep inside Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPIDERWEB was an 18-month operation of total secrecy and tremendous complexity, conducted by the most drone-proficient state in the world in the context of an existential defensive war. The recent European incursions by ‘capable actors’ appear to be an extension of other incidences of ‘grey-zone’ harassment, intended to demonstrate capability and disrupt civilian infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different as they are, both incidences represent a wider trend in which the ‘near surface’ of European homelands is increasingly threatened. More concerningly still, tactics need not be confined to state actors, but could easily be co-opted by organized crime or terrorist groups. In the United Kingdom, drone incidents related to&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/counter-drone-efforts-rise-as-prison-sightings-revealed"&gt; smuggling contraband into prisons&lt;/a&gt; have risen by 43 per cent within the last year, whilst the technology involved is developing at such a rate that the Chief Inspector for Prisons warned that prisoners could soon be ‘&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/counter-drone-efforts-rise-as-prison-sightings-revealed"&gt;lifted out’ by drone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;use xlink:href="#icon-open-quote" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The trend is clear: malicious drone use within Europe’s ‘home territories’ is becoming more achievable, prevalent, and dangerous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether challenged by a rogue state or non-state actor, authorities must be ready to credibly respond. Given the cheap drones, open-source software and open-access control mechanisms used during SPIDERWEB, a simplistic terror attack against a city centre using a quadcopter is not difficult to conceptualize.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complex one, using a larger UAS to destroy an aircraft, could be devastating. Whether by adversary states today, or terrorist groups tomorrow, the trend is clear: malicious drone use within Europe’s home territories is becoming more achievable, prevalent, and dangerous. To deter such a threat, European governments should implement three key measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Develop and deploy a wide spectrum of C-UAS options&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We need to look into effective means of how to destroy’, stated Mr Kubilius. Detection methods such as traditional radar are circumventable by smaller UAS, and difficult to apply universally. Therefore, a wide variety of counter-UAS (C-UAS) should be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many options at the tactical level already exist, including devices for firing nets; electro-magnetic (EM) devices which can remotely control or disable drones; counter-drones to intercept hostile drones; directed-energy weapons (i.e. lasers); and traditional munitions (i.e. shotguns).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every solution will be appropriate for every situation: EM measures are typically passive, blocking off areas from all drones rather than targeting specific ones, and other methods carry obvious risks to the public. However, given the sheer variety of drones, and possible scenarios, the widest possible options should be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such capabilities should be integrated within frameworks that prioritize speed of response, and give effective legal protection to their users. It is easy to buy drone interception devices, position powerful lasers, and train personnel with shotguns. It is far more difficult to effectively legislate for their safe, rapid use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Develop robust command, control, and co-ordination structures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the variety of UAS and actors operating them, another challenge will be effectively co-ordinating between military and civil authorities. On Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/germany" title="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;’s Interior Minister, Alexander Dobrindt,&lt;a href="https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/09/28/germany-wants-to-create-a-center-for-defense-against-drones/"&gt; announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to establish a German UAV defence centre, bringing together police, the federal criminal office, and the German Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Cooperation across Europe is essential. The ‘drone wall’ is a promising start.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the international reach of such devices, cooperation across Europe is essential. The ‘drone wall’, suggested by Mr Kubiliuis is a promising start, but estimates of up to a year until effective establishment threaten the initiative. The &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-and-sweden-deploy-anti-drone-troops-to-copenhagen-ahead-of-eu-summits/"&gt;deployment of French and Swedish&lt;/a&gt; counter-UAS troops to Copenhagen on Monday, ahead of two crucial European summits, is a welcome example of what can be achieved by co-operating at pace.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/drone-wall-needed-europe-defend-against-new-threat</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:58:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The International Affairs summer reading list 2025</title><link>https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/the-international-affairs-summer-reading-list-2025-25822cd8643f?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</link><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g2qFnA7t29K-y2TMYHjKbQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is nothing quite like spending the summer lost within the pages of a great book — or ten.

In this new book, Owens unearths the contributions of 18 women to bury any narratives of the International Relations (IR) discipline as a story of elite white men. While spotlighting their academic merits, especially on the debate around empire and race in IR, Owens also enquires about these women’s careers and lives: where were they able to secure writing opportunities? Which powerful men played a role in their personal and professional lives? This unique intellectual history covers it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf132"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Rise of the international&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0yV9DxlqeIndNcvIaUP65Q.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Richard Devetak and Tim Dunne. Published in Oxford by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Jeremy Bentham coined the term ‘international’ in eighteenth-century England, the concept has travelled far and wide, often through the imperial and colonial channels. This dynamic edited volume brings historians and theorists of International Relations (IR) into conversation to investigate the diversity of internationals, their varied conceptualizations and the different contexts that led to their emergence. The chapters are actor-driven, focusing on how several conceived of the ‘international’ and showcasing how the concept was understood, contested and developed in different socio-political spaces. The ideal book for anyone who wants to understand the ways in which the ‘international’ always remains plural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf126"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Living the Asian century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pIYru_c64WJYzQo5OBEkxg.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Kishore Mahbubani. Published in New York by PublicAffairs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most contemporary international affairs observers, Kishore Mahbubani needs no introduction. However, if one must be offered, this memoir is the perfect window into the life of former Singaporean diplomat and leading thinker on the role of Asian superpowers in the declining US-led international order. In &lt;em&gt;Living the Asian century&lt;/em&gt;, Mahbubani draws on his decades of experience, including at the United Nations, to expose the US dominance in the organization and to offer sobering and inspiring advice for policy-makers from small states. Combining deeply personal experiences and anecdotes, Mahbubani’s lessons from and for diplomacy are wide-ranging and relevant for students of Asian politics and practitioners of world affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf114"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Unexpected revolutionaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y9VYWpL1ZMt4fGn3HPva7g.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Manuela Moschella. Published in Ithaca, NY by Cornell University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this brilliant addition to the literature, former Chatham House Associate Fellow Manuela Moschella looks at how central banks’ incentives to expand their toolboxes and their scope are largely a result of imperatives for institutional adaptation. The author analyses the success stories of the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to underscore her central argument that banks’ strategic behaviour matters and that they often enact changes to build support, preserve their power and maintain their independence. An insightful and timely book in the age of political backlash against technocratic decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf116"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Assembly by design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_UOedt_q34To57VUQAi8qw.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Olga Touloumi. Published in Minneapolis, MN by University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does the architecture of the United Nations headquarters tell us about the organization? According to Olga Toulomi, efforts to make the UN architecturally different from its predecessor reveal the tension between the institution’s inclusionary and exclusionary impulses. This expertly titled book turns to spatial politics to illustrate the physical shape of these impulses, as well as the relationship between the core (UN headquarters) and its periphery (the UN’s operational field). As our reviewer concludes, the UN site confirms that ‘while the UN’s global interior is designed to speak to the world, it has a limited capacity to listen to it’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf122"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Good victims&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nYPHpLVnpSD8gllvGNhi3w.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Roxani Krystalli.

If it also receives a stellar review in &lt;em&gt;International Affairs&lt;/em&gt;, then you should be wondering why you have not read it yet. In her first book, Roxani Krystalli delves into the Colombian transitional justice context to provide a ‘caring and graceful’ examination of what it means to be a good victim in the eyes of the institutions and bureaucracies that dispatch justice in post-conflict settings. Krystalli’s exploration of the performative aspects of victimhood draws on more than 150 interviews to render visible the institutional expectations, costs and dangers of discreet identities of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ victims, in a contribution to feminist studies that will not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf077"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The derecognition of states&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DEj-lAN9-4zPRk9Xpf46aw.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Gëzim Visoka. Published in Ann Arbor, MI by Michigan University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criteria for state sovereignty and state recognition have been widely debated in the disciplines for decades. But what about derecognition? In this open-access book, Gëzim Visoka draws on five case-studies to explain why states withdraw recognition, what rationales they offer and what regional consequences these processes can have. From Kosovo to Taiwan and Western Sahara, the examples showcase the complex interplay of political, strategic and diplomatic factors that drive derecognition efforts. As these states have found out the hard way, meeting statehood (or sovereignty) criteria is far less important than other geopolitical developments. A seemingly counter-intuitive yet entirely compelling argument, considering this book’s evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf111"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Asia after Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jD2VLT1hA4l4-nHgb27lZA.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Sugata Bose. Published in Cambridge, MA by Belknap Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Mahbubani thinks the twenty-first century is shaping up to be Asian, Sugata Bose’s sweeping narrative reminds readers that those on the continent were far from inward-looking in the twentieth century. To underline this argument, &lt;em&gt;Asia after Europe&lt;/em&gt; draws on the interconnections between a cast of (Asian) characters and colonial history, from a Parsi trader’s role in the Opium Wars to Mahatma Gandhi’s solidarity with Muslims after the fall of the Ottoman empire. Bose’s fresh interpretation of global history extends to other familiar episodes, including the 1930s Great Depression and the 1955 Bandung Conference. The result is a challenging and reflective account of the ways in which Asian international solidarity consolidated and fractured over this transformative century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf123"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The soft power of non-western small states&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*evJ84SvXEgO3Gn4PRHDE8g.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Sarina Theys. Published in Abingdon and New York by Routledge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Mahbubani provides practical experience of small states’ diplomacy, Sarina Theys turns to Bhutan and Qatar to challenge conventional notions of power and size. While Theys is not the first to recognize the influence of small states in global politics, her latest book offers an intersubjective understanding of smallness and identity. In other words, Theys takes into consideration Bhutan’s and Qatar’s efforts regarding identity projection, mapping out their multiple identities before observing how these efforts translate (or fail to translate) into soft power influence. Overall, this is an empirically rigorous and conceptually innovative book that pushes the boundaries of western-centric literature.

Published in London by Bloomsbury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every so often, a debut book makes its way onto our list of recommendations: this unassuming monograph is certainly worth the attention of students and scholars of peace and conflict studies. Drawing on United Nations archives and original interviews with a variety of relevant actors, Miranda Melcher offers a comprehensive analysis of two complete peace processes to expand readers’ knowledge of how to negotiate and implement a peace treaty. There is ample merit in Melcher’s comparative approach, especially as the civil wars in Angola and Mozambique allow for a significant reflection on lessons learned, including the importance of a balance between specificity and flexibility in peace deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae294"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mariana Vieira is the Book Reviews Editor of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;International Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find the latest book reviews section in our July 2025 issue &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/issue/101/4#2222506-8178346"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more reading suggestions, check out the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/tagged/ia-bookshelf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IA Bookshelf series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are interested in reviewing a book for the journal, register your interest in our book review application form &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6ZOiHKZ2WYj8UEaaXy9-gVuv_0ONmB2x2pv1x9-VcSWwCdg/viewform"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All views expressed are individual not institutional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=25822cd8643f" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/the-international-affairs-summer-reading-list-2025-25822cd8643f"&gt;The International Affairs summer reading list 2025&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog"&gt;International Affairs Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/the-international-affairs-summer-reading-list-2025-25822cd8643f?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 10:48:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Top 5 books: May 2025</title><link>https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-5-books-may-2025-dc5e1f1a4564?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</link><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g2qFnA7t29K-y2TMYHjKbQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unless you live near the Equator or at the geographical poles, Spring can be an unpredictable season (especially in the UK’s island of rain).

Published in Cham, Switzerland by Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force in 2009, it provided for the appointment of the very first EU High Representative/Vice-President (HRVP). Combining two previous roles, the foreign policy chief and the vice-presidency of the European Commission, the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/19/eu-high-representative-foreig-minister"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; the role as ‘less senior, but more powerful’. Three EU HRVPs later, Niklas Helwig has taken on the challenge of comparing and assessing their mandates to ascertain which factors increase or restrain the HRVP’s effectiveness. In his ‘thoughtful exploration’, Helwig considers institutional constraints, leadership styles and the incumbent’s ability to leverage resources while navigating member-state interests as well as external challenges. Anyone interested in Europe’s role on the global stage will benefit greatly from this unassuming book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf097"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) World of the right&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CGX4CZ-DCg7bAKqFes_AqA.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Rita Abrahamsen, Jean-François Drolet, Michael C.

Published in Cambridge by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think that the far right is simply an outgrowth of socio-economic alienation, this star-studded line-up of leading scholars urges you to think again. &lt;em&gt;World of the right&lt;/em&gt; immerses readers in this cosmos, demonstrating that the political ambitions of far-right leaders are informing a ‘globally interconnected political and cultural alliance, committed to charting an illiberal and radically conservative future for the world’. Drawing on the appropriation of Antonio Gramsci’s work, the authors trace the radical right’s multilayered attempts to build its ‘own brand of hegemony’. From training and educating a global elite to cutting across North/South divides, the far-right international alliance makes an exceptionally timely object of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf082"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) The end of engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wfzyOflie6cG-IaXbBpAng.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by David M. McCourt. Published in New York by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, David McCourt wrote an article for &lt;em&gt;International Affairs&lt;/em&gt; outlining how the different national security fields in the UK, US and Australia produced different framings of China’s rise. McCourt’s latest book builds on this political sociological approach and extends his effort to add nuance to our understanding of two knowledge communities that feature prominently in the US national security context: the China and the Russia watchers. The book benefits from McCourt’s almost 200 interviews with individuals from these two groupings, to report on how three dynamics eroded US engagement policies with China and Russia in widely different ways. Moving away from the focus on top-level government advisers, McCourt’s framework bridges the gap between scholars and practitioners in a book that will appeal to both audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf095"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Born of war in Colombia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J3dsskZgTqQN4CqpA5wnYQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Tatiana Sanchez Parra. Published in New Brunswick, NJ by Rutgers University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, a books blog of this kind will prioritize showcasing the spread of our book reviews’ coverage. Exceptionally, we are returning to the Colombian post-conflict society to provide a fascinating companion read to Krystalli’s monograph. In this eye-opening account, Tatiana Sanchez Parra adopts a narrative voice to foreground the experiences of forced motherhood and reproductive violence and the political struggles of women and their children born of war. Sanchez Parra’s anthropological attention to these victims underscores the limitations of a ‘past-oriented and harm-centered model of transitional justice’ whereby ‘the gendered ways in which conflict continues to remake their lives, beyond sexual violence, fall largely outside the scope of the machinery of transitional justice’.

All issues of the journal feature a comprehensive book reviews section, which surveys the latest writing on international politics. The titles below spotlight appraisals of the Women, Peace and Security agenda as well as of the British empire, and new writing on the often-overlooked impact of everyday foreign policy in Russia and India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Governing the feminist peace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dClObJ_sfRDlJaEv_up73A.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Paul Kirby and Laura J. Shepherd. Published in New York by Columbia University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its brilliantly illustrated cover, this co-authored book has a much wider appeal. Paul Kirby and Laura Shepherd have teamed up for a provocative and convincing critique of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, as a product of specific global governance frameworks. Deploying some impressive empirical research, &lt;em&gt;Governing the feminist peace&lt;/em&gt; persuasively highlights the incoherent, contested and contingent nature of the WPS discourse, particularly as it features in the fields of policy and governance. In the words of our reviewer: ‘forgetting WPS, in the way that Kirby and Shepherd suggest, might provide an opportunity to expand the ethical imaginaries of war and peace’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae203"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Empireworld&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EtwoKbjN_n3lr37bA6obQQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Sathnam Sanghera. Published in New York by Viking Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Empireworld&lt;/em&gt;, British journalist Sathnam Sanghera has delivered an outstanding sequel to &lt;em&gt;Empireland&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Viking Press, 2021), exploring the impact of the British empire around the globe. Drawing on the colonial legacies in India, Barbados, Mauritius and Nigeria, the author sheds light on how Modi instrumentalizes imperialism in his electoral campaign; how former centres of the slave trade are demanding reparations; and how Nigerian democracy embodies the contradictions of empire. This lucid and accessible examination of the imperial spread of white supremacist ideas, and the mixed record of democracy promotion, will benefit those interested in British history as well as those working in diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae198"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Everyday foreign policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GwbjJSOCBTwtTXMdUX4Qbw.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Elizaveta Gaufman. Published in Manchester by Manchester University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Crimea and its subsequent war in Ukraine has inspired a cottage industry of books on both countries. And yet, Elizaveta Gaufman has identified a significant gap when it comes to the complex intersection of Russian foreign policy with daily life. Combining seven thematic case-studies with interviews, &lt;em&gt;Everyday foreign policy&lt;/em&gt; examines Russia’s (in)effectiveness in spreading its values throughout society. The book uncovers the role of both hard and soft power while accounting for how ordinary Russians have experienced ‘their country’s turn to extreme nationalism over the last decade’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae193"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Cosmopolitan elites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mA4iL_7iSK2P60Sf7zyAwQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Kira Huju. Published in Oxford by Oxford University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connoisseurs of Kira Huju’s 2022 &lt;em&gt;International Affairs&lt;/em&gt; article, ‘&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiab220"&gt;Saffronizing diplomacy: the Indian Foreign Service under Hindu nationalist rule&lt;/a&gt;’, will find Huju’s first book eminently rewarding. In &lt;em&gt;Cosmopolitan elites&lt;/em&gt;, Huju picks up the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) once again, to expose how class, caste, gender and religion shape its composition. The author brings in everyday practices and domestic hierarchies to illustrate the exclusionary codes that dictate participation in international society. The book benefits from a broad historical scope that allows Huju to document the enduring tension between the influence of colonial ideals and the aspirations of a postcolonial India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae188"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Memory fragmentation from below and beyond the state&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lD3ADMvc3CmLaky2-QiN4Q.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Anne Bazin, Emmanuelle Hébert, Valérie Rosoux and Eric Sangar. Published in Abingdon and New York by Routledge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No reading list is complete — this year at least — without the latest writing on memory politics. This excellent edited volume offers 17 chapters dedicated to two different logics of memory fragmentation: vertical and horizontal. The former focuses on conflict memory discourses resulting from how political communities use the past differently, whereas the latter maps out discourses that transcend national boundaries. The book’s sections are helpfully divided according to four different types of (largely non-state) actors that can shape memory discourses. Despite the limited geographical focus on European case-studies, this is a great addition to the literature; the contributions on the role of gender and women in memory are especially welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae190"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mariana Vieira is the Book Reviews Editor of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;International Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find the latest book reviews section in our September 2024 issue &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/issue/100/5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more reading suggestions, check out the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/tagged/ia-bookshelf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IA Bookshelf series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are interested in reviewing a book for the journal, register your interest in our book review application form &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6ZOiHKZ2WYj8UEaaXy9-gVuv_0ONmB2x2pv1x9-VcSWwCdg/viewform"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and follow us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IAJournal_CH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;social media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; where we post regular call outs for specific books and experts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All views expressed are individual not institutional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=544999e68f7c" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-5-books-september-2024-544999e68f7c"&gt;Top 5 books: September 2024&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog"&gt;International Affairs Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-5-books-september-2024-544999e68f7c?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 12:10:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>China’s tech advance means Western corporations must adapt to compete</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/11/chinas-tech-advance-means-western-corporations-must-adapt-compete</link><description>&lt;span&gt;China’s tech advance means Western corporations must adapt to compete&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Western policymakers should wake up to China’s emerging tech dominance and seek to self-strengthen to withstand the disruptive power of Chinese tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;China is winning the tech race against the US in almost all sectors and leaving Europe far behind. Saying this would have been controversial only a few short months ago, but such a realization is now becoming more mainstream.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Farley, the CEO of US car giant Ford, &lt;a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/777587/ford-chinese-automakers/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; last month: ‘They have enough [production] capacity in China with existing factories to serve the entire North American market, put us all out of business. Japan never had that, so this is a completely different level of risk for our industry.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Jensen Huang, CEO of the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia, had &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/53295276-ba8d-4ec2-b0de-081e73b3ba43"&gt;a similar take:&lt;/a&gt; ‘China is going to win the AI race.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;China is winning the tech race against the US in almost all sectors and leaving Europe far behind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk to some of the largest corporations in the West is stark. As Chinese companies ascend to the cutting edge of global tech, often offering products at sharp discounts to those of Western competitors, disruptive shocks have started to hit some of the West’s largest and most famous corporations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruption events come in different forms. Some are preceded by CEO warnings over Chinese competition. These may be followed by the ceding of market share to Chinese competitors either in China itself or in markets overseas. Later, evidence of disruption may come with lowered earnings’ forecasts and the issuance of guidance to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that Chinese companies are making rapid strides in technological upgrading, often through innovation. Research from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) shows that China leads the US in &lt;a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/aspis-two-decade-critical-technology-tracker/"&gt;57 out of 64&lt;/a&gt; critical technology categories. In the period between 2003-2007, ASPI found that China led in just three of the 64 technologies assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples from three key industries – pharmaceuticals, electric vehicles and wind power – among many others highlight the impact of China’s disruptive shocks. If Western corporations are to weather these shocks, they need to self-strengthen and adapt with various strategies, supported by meaningful government-led industrial policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pharmaceuticals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges faced by Merck and Co, a large US pharmaceutical company, reveal the disruptive power of emerging Chinese pharma companies. Merck’s share price plunged on a few occasions in 2024 and early 2025 due to the declining sales of a popular HPV vaccine, Gardasil, in China.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stress the company felt was partly due to the emergence of a Chinese competitor drug, Cecolin 9, developed by Xiamen Innovax Biotech. The price of Cecolin 9 was set at a 60 per cent &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/pressuring-mercks-gardasil-china-home-made-9-valent-hpv-vaccine-priced-60-discount"&gt;discount&lt;/a&gt; to that of Merck’s Gardasil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 4 this year, Merck shares tumbled 11 per cent in early trade after the company announced it would temporarily halt shipments of Gardasil to China. While Merck said it remained confident in Gardasil’s future sales prospects in China overall, it withdrew its long-term &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/merck-puts-temporary-kibosh-gardasil-shipments-china-local-demand-hpv-vaccine-nosedives"&gt;$11bn sales target&lt;/a&gt; for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another potential disruption to Merck’s business comes from Akeso, a Chinese biotech company that &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2025/07/16/how-this-new-biotech-billionaire-outmaneuvered-merck-in-china/"&gt;beat Merck’s Keytruda,&lt;/a&gt; a multibillion dollar blockbuster cancer drug, in a head-to-head trial. Akeso won approvals in China for its new drug, ivonescimab, which is now on sale in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s position as a global leader in pharmaceutical R&amp;amp;D is demonstrated by a series of announcements by European companies to boost their research presence in China. UK-based AstraZeneca pledged this year to build a $2.5bn R&amp;amp;D hub in Beijing. Novo Nordisk, the Denmark-based company, and Roche Group, the Swiss giant, have also announced large expansion plans in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Electric and hybrid vehicles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s march into electric and hybrid vehicle markets around the world is the most commonly cited example of its disruptive technological power. In September this year, Chinese car companies captured a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-29/china-blows-past-record-for-europe-car-sales-on-hybrid-ev-gains"&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; 7.4 per cent of all passenger car sales across Europe, up from 3.9 per cent at the start of the year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese car companies posted bumper increases in Europe sales. BYD registered a 304 per cent increase in year-on-year sales in the first nine months of this year, while Chery notched up an 862 per cent rise and Leapmotor, which makes ultra-affordable cars, posted a 7,108 per cent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlos Tavares, former CEO of Stellantis, warned last month that as Western carmakers stumble, Chinese competitors will be ready to snap them up. ‘The day a Western carmaker is in severe difficulty, with factories on the verge of closing and demonstrations in the street, a Chinese carmaker will come and say ‘I’ll take it and keep the jobs’, and they’ll be considered saviours,’ Tavares &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/555499db-9ea5-45df-949d-20321556eee3"&gt;said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share prices of VW, Mercedes Benz, Stellantis and other European automakers are &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/business/2024/09/12/why-are-these-6-top-european-car-maker-stocks-trading-at-record-lows"&gt;sharply down&lt;/a&gt; from the highs they hit in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wind power&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese manufacturers of wind turbines have been gaining global market share. In 2024, Chinese companies took six out of the top 10 slots for turbine makers worldwide, &lt;a href="https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/chinese-manufacturers-lead-global-wind-turbine-installations-bloombergnef-report-shows/"&gt;according to Bloomberg.&lt;/a&gt; Among these, the top four places went to Chinese makers for the first time. European and US manufacturers fell out of the top three, also for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s rise is propelled by a domestic market that installed about 80GW of wind power last year alone, or about 60 per cent of the extra capacity installed globally. But the competitive challenge that leading companies such as Goldwind, Envision and Mingyang present to Western competitors GE, Siemens Energy and Vestas lies mainly in the fact that Chinese-made turbines can be up to &lt;a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/explainer-china%27s-dominance-in-wind-turbine-manufacturing/75456763"&gt;50 per cent cheaper.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological disruption is also underway. Dongfang Electric, a Chinese company, also took the mantle for making the world’s most powerful turbine – &lt;a href="https://www.offshorewind.biz/2025/09/03/dongfang-installs-worlds-largest-single-capacity-offshore-wind-turbine-for-testing/"&gt;a 26MW offshore prototype&lt;/a&gt; with blades that are 153 meters in length – from Siemens Gamesa earlier this year. This technological breakthrough is likely to further reduce the cost per unit of electricity generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Western corporations can adapt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies are dominating globally or taking greater market share in a range of other industries, including cellular modules, lithium-ion batteries, 5G telecoms equipment, solar power, nuclear power, factory automation, robotics (including humanoid robots), electrical equipment and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruptive events are likely to grow more common across all these key sectors. Western corporations therefore need to adopt a series of strategies to self-strengthen and pre-empt disruptive events before they happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These strategies may include climbing the technology ladder, including by investing heavily in R&amp;amp;D inside China as, for example, Germany’s VW and Mercedes Benz have done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western corporations may also consider restructuring to cut costs, so they are better able to compete with Chinese price-setters, as well as strategic alliances to create efficiencies and boost brands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/11/chinas-tech-advance-means-western-corporations-must-adapt-compete</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 09:08:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Greece’s LNG energy hub ambitions will help EU needs now – but should not shape long-term policy</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/11/greeces-lng-energy-hub-ambitions-will-help-eu-needs-now-should-not-shape-long-term-policy</link><description>&lt;span&gt;Greece’s LNG energy hub ambitions will help EU needs now – but should not shape long-term policy&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Relying on imports of US LNG carries economic and environmental risk. In the long term, Greece should invest in its considerable clean energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;US and European energy officials gather in Athens on 6 November at the 6th Partnership for Transatlantic Energy Cooperation (P-TEC). The summit aims to discuss Southeastern Europe’s revamped energy agenda, focusing on the acceleration of US Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) flows into the region. Greece, host of the summit, is positioning itself as a regional energy hub, doubling down on LNG infrastructure investment in pursuit of an upgraded geopolitical role.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘energy hub’ narrative stems from the energy crisis of recent years, which saw European countries turn to LNG – much of it shipped from the US &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; to compensate for dramatically reduced Russian pipeline inflows. Since then, Europe’s regasification capacity – allowing it to convert LNG back into gas for distribution – has increased by 32 per cent. Gas consumption in the EU decreased by &lt;a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/markets-and-consumers/actions-and-measures-energy-prices/repowereu-3-years_en"&gt;17 per cent&lt;/a&gt; due to REPowerEU energy efficiency and clean energy initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;July’s EU&lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;US trade deal featured a pledge that the EU would purchase $750 billion of US energy products over three years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New EU sanctions against Russia, targeting the complete phase out of Russian LNG by 2027, emphasize the urgent need for alternative supply, especially as the last Russian pipeline to Europe through Turkey goes offline by 2028. Greece’s strategic position, at the intersection of continents and a gateway to the Balkans, bolsters its candidacy as a suitable hub.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US imports stand to play a leading role in this project. July’s EU–US trade deal featured a pledge that the EU would purchase $750 billion of US energy products over three years. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/americas/united-states-america" title="United States of America"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; and Qatar are &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/qatar-us-urge-eu-reconsider-sustainability-rules-lng-trade-2025-10-22/"&gt;pressuring the EU to loosen climate regulations&lt;/a&gt; to permit greater LNG flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Greece is developing two new import terminals, in addition to the existing facilities at Alexandroupolis and Revithoussa (Attica). The intention is that Greece will become the source of new LNG supplies to the region via the ‘&lt;a href="https://usea.org/sites/default/files/The%20Vertical%20Gas%20Corridor_0.pdf"&gt;Vertical Corridor&lt;/a&gt;’, a pipeline network passing from Greece through Bulgaria, Romania, and Moldova to Ukraine. This route recently became more attractive, after participating countries multilaterally &lt;a href="https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2025/10/24/11148954/ukraine-greece-route-2-3-ready-to-launch-as-icgb-slashes-tariff-by-46-market-sources/"&gt;reduced their transit tariffs&lt;/a&gt; to compete with a northern route from Lithuania and Poland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while the ‘energy hub’ project will make an important contribution in the short term and could upgrade Greece’s geopolitical role, long-term reliance on US LNG carries significant economic and environmental risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High prices and uncertain reliability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine saw natural gas prices spike, leading to exorbitant electricity prices throughout Europe. Prices stabilized in the past year, but natural gas remains &lt;a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/natural-gas"&gt;almost triple the price&lt;/a&gt; of pre-crisis levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war, EU countries have spent &lt;a href="https://ieefa.org/articles/europes-lng-buildout-slows-amid-anticipated-decline-gas-demand"&gt;€258 billion on LNG imports&lt;/a&gt;. This has played an important role in ensuring energy security – but unlike pipeline gas, which ensures some fixed security of supply, US LNG works with ‘free-on-board terms’, meaning that sellers can redirect shipments to the highest-bidder across the globe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that regardless of the level of new infrastructure Greece builds, it and other countries in the region will remain exposed to global gas price volatility and risk, potentially keeping electricity prices structurally high without guaranteeing supply. In 2025, on average, Greece bought US LNG at &lt;a href="https://ieefa.org/european-lng-tracker"&gt;the highest price in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The long transport and regasification process further exacerbates the environmental impact [of LNG].&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the EU’s carbon permit &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/analysts-eu-carbon-price-forecasts-steady-us-tariff-concerns-linger-2025-07-16/"&gt;prices are expected to soar&lt;/a&gt; in the coming years, putting further pressure on electricity prices from fossil fuels. That will reverberate throughout the economy and influence the region’s competitiveness. Should US electricity prices rise &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; a real possibility as the US administration inhibits green energy projects and energy demand from data centres increases &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; this risk could be exacerbated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environmental impact of LNG is also considerable. Long touted as a ‘transition fuel’, &lt;a href="https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ese3.1934"&gt;new research with the help of satellite data&lt;/a&gt; has shown LNG methane leakage could be far worse than previously estimated. Though emitting less carbon dioxide than coal, LNG’s elevated methane emissions would have a stronger short-term warming effect. The long transport and regasification process further exacerbates the environmental impact. Increasing reliance on LNG therefore risks jeopardizing EU decarbonization goals and legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The alternative&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greece is well-positioned as a stable hub to distribute supply gas to Southeastern Europe. Yet, it is also well-suited to become a regional hub for clean energy &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; one that can help fulfil the EU’s energy security needs while protecting its decarbonization targets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Acceleration of investments in storage technologies, such as batteries (BESS), would be key to maximize the utility of Greece’s vast renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece is already a regional leader in green energy generation: green sources produce over half of the country’s electricity and are &lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/b2fbbef4-ee32-44fc-acce-49737bf492c8_en?filename=EL%20%E2%80%93%20FINAL%20UPDATED%20NECP%202021-2030%20%28English%29.pdf"&gt;expected to grow&lt;/a&gt;. Continuing momentum towards the green energy transition could help attract alternative overseas investment, as clean energy initiatives &lt;a href="https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/global-renewable-energy-investment-reaches-new-record-as-investors-reassess-risks/"&gt;retreat from the US&lt;/a&gt;. Greece would also increase its soft power by distinguishing itself as a climate leader, in contrast to other countries such as Turkey, which recently announced &lt;a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/8-7-billion-coal-subsidy-contradicts-turkiyes-renewable-goals/supporting-materials/"&gt;massive new coal subsidies&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acceleration of investments in storage technologies, such as &lt;a href="https://balkangreenenergynews.com/greece-plans-4-7-gw-of-commercial-battery-storage-projects/"&gt;batteries (BESS)&lt;/a&gt;, would be key to maximize the utility of &amp;nbsp;Greece’s vast renewable energy sources. Last year, &lt;a href="https://balkangreenenergynews.com/renewables-keep-top-spot-in-greeces-power-mix-despite-surge-in-curtailments/"&gt;about 10 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of renewable energy generation was curtailed (wasted) during high-output hours, signalling a dire need for energy storage to relieve grid congestion. The market conditions are favourable to battery growth given negative prices and high intraday spreads. However, &lt;a href="https://voiceofrenewables.com/greeces-renewable-energy-2025-growth-surges-amid-grid-and-storage-challenges/"&gt;licensing&lt;/a&gt; and permitting in Greece remain an obstacle to the purported goal to install 4.7GW of battery capacity in the country by 2030.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean technology also involves risk, mainly related to reliance on Chinese imports of batteries and renewable energy components. But it is a one-time-deal: once the infrastructure is established, energy supply would be far less exposed to the kind of continuous reliance produced by gas supply. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the challenges, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has clearly demonstrated the inherent risk in, fossil-fuel imports-based energy strategies. Indeed, European natural gas demand is expected to fall next year, raising the risk that new LNG terminals become stranded assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exports&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common argument for Greece’s LNG hub ambitions is that it has an opportunity to become an energy exporter to the Western Balkans. With some exceptions, &lt;a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/balka-seltzer-how-to-avoid-excess-gas-in-the-western-balkans/"&gt;countries in the region use minimal gas&lt;/a&gt;, but much of what is used derives from Russia. New Greek sources could therefore provide an important stop-gap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="media__content"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The EU should insist on its regulations, backing its role as a global regulatory superpower.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the long term, Greece should plan to export electricity to the region rather than gas. That will prevent locking western Balkan countries into fossil fuel-based solutions, lower electricity prices, and align with their &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/topics/european-union-eu" title="European Union (EU)"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; membership ambitions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/11/greeces-lng-energy-hub-ambitions-will-help-eu-needs-now-should-not-shape-long-term-policy</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 12:04:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s tariffs face Supreme Court challenge that could have significant consequences for presidential power</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/11/trumps-tariffs-face-supreme-court-challenge-could-have-significant-consequences</link><description>&lt;span&gt;Trump’s tariffs face Supreme Court challenge that could have significant consequences for presidential power&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case concerns tariffs levied under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which empowers the president to declare a national emergency over an ‘unusual and extraordinary’ foreign threat and respond with a range of actions, including sanctions and the freezing of funds. IEEPA has never before been used as a basis for tariffs nor does the statute explicitly authorize them, though President Richard Nixon &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN11129#:~:text=Although%20IEEPA%20has%20never%20previously%20been%20used,States%20in%20response%20to%20a%20monetary%20crisis."&gt;relied&lt;/a&gt; on a similarly worded law to impose an emergency tariff on imports in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the US Constitution, taxation is Congress’s remit. The power to impose tariffs can be delegated to the executive under the right circumstances, including &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF13006"&gt;authority&lt;/a&gt; presidents have used across administrations to impose sectoral tariffs on national security grounds. Unlike his predecessors, however, Trump is also using IEEPA to impose tariffs, including levies on China, Mexico and Canada linked to &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/"&gt;fentanyl supply chains&lt;/a&gt;, ‘reciprocal tariffs’ on global trading partners in response to the US’s &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-06063.pdf"&gt;trade deficit&lt;/a&gt;, and recent measures targeting developments in &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/05/2025-14896/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-the-russian-federation/"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court’s ruling is expected in the months ahead. What consequences could either outcome have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upholding the tariffs would have significant implications for presidential power&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case goes beyond tariffs to the foundational issue of unilateral executive authority. Before the Supreme Court are two core questions: does IEEPA authorize the tariffs imposed? If so, does it unconstitutionally delegate Congress’s authority?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome will shape Trump’s presidency – and those that follow – across executive authority, global trade, and domestic fiscal and economic concerns. It is likewise a salient moment for the Supreme Court, which has empowered Trump and showed little appetite to constrain him. Now, the justices must &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/the-world-today/2025-09/what-happens-if-american-courts-cant-keep-trump-check" title="What happens if the American courts can’t keep Trump in check?"&gt;navigate&lt;/a&gt; several cases testing the boundaries of presidential power – from tariffs to control over independent agencies – that could irrevocably alter the separation of powers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upholding the tariffs would seemingly be the least disruptive option in the short term, despite US consumers facing, by some accounts, the &lt;a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-october-30-2025"&gt;highest&lt;/a&gt; average effective tariff rate since 1934. Existing trade agreements would endure, and markets and trading partners would have certainty in the tools available to the president. This does nothing, however, to alleviate the uncertainty stemming from his power ‘to raise or lower tariffs unbounded by any limits on geography, rates, or the types of products covered’, as highlighted by an &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1287/380641/20251024173045050_24-1287 25-150 Amicus Brief.pdf"&gt;amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; submitted to the court.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an interpretation of IEEPA could have far-reaching consequences. If the Supreme Court were to support its use for tariffs, the same statutory language could justify other unilateral and discretionary taxes involving foreign interests, such as offshored profits, the transport of goods or outbound investment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-center embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upholding the tariffs would legitimize the president’s use of an emergency declaration – even on the thinnest grounds – to circumvent Congress in matters of national importance, setting precedent well beyond trade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress could intervene in extreme cases – a bipartisan group of Senators recently voted to end the national emergencies justifying tariffs on Brazilian and &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/canada-tariffs-senate-vote-trump?utm_source=semafor"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; goods – but Trump’s allies in the House of Representatives would be expected to block any such measures, demonstrating the limitations of an acquiescent Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, upholding the tariffs would legitimize the president’s use of an emergency declaration – even on the thinnest grounds – to circumvent Congress in matters of national importance, setting precedent well beyond trade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Invalidating the tariffs would see them replaced quickly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If instead the Supreme Court were to invalidate the tariffs, it would create more immediate turmoil as the average effective tariff rate would be roughly &lt;a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-october-30-2025"&gt;halved&lt;/a&gt; overnight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the Trump administration would replicate tariff coverage as quickly as possible using other measures. As US Trade Representative &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b1deb172-3c11-4a81-85ee-8e21a7fc31c4"&gt;Jamieson Greer&lt;/a&gt; put it, ‘we’ll be able to have the same effect.’ Even absent precise replacements, other statutes can backfill IEEPA tariffs. Although required investigation and consultations would take time and resources, it is not inconceivable the administration would try to bypass process and tempt a new round of lawsuits. In the interim, Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act could provide a bridge: a tariff of up to 15 per cent for 150 days in response to balance of payments imbalances.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/11/trumps-tariffs-face-supreme-court-challenge-could-have-significant-consequences</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:43:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Sanae Takaichi sees herself as the successor to Shinzo Abe.

&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new Japanese prime minister and LDP leader has been elected partly to see off a surging far right, at a time of significant change in society.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class="media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image"&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="Sanae Takaichi stands up to acknowledge the applause after she was selected as Japan's new prime minister in Tokyo on 21 October, 2025." height="630" src="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2025-10/2025-10-21-takaichi-2241946707.jpg?itok=PuvsOfIx" width="1200" /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Following a vote in the House of Representatives on 21 October, Japan has elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. Cabinet appointments are underway. But the Takaichi government now faces numerous challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takaichi claims to be the successor to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his assertive Japanese foreign policy, which built new security partnerships, boosted defence spending, and expanded the remit of the country’s Self Defense Forces. But Takaichi’s ability to replicate Abe’s success is uncertain, as she leads a weakened Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), confronts a surging far right at home, and negotiates relations with an unpredictable US partner. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Komeito’s withdrawal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant problem facing Takaichi’s ability to form a government was the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-komeito-takaichi-politics-coalition-e9fe611e8868f6ce3ad8241dff7965ff"&gt;withdrawal of the Komeito Party&lt;/a&gt; from its coalition earlier this month. Komeito had been a partner for the past 26 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komeito’s decision to leave the coalition was ostensibly based on the LDP’s recent record in government. The LDP faced nationwide criticism after it was revealed during the Kishida administration that it had neglected its reporting obligations regarding income from party fundraising systems. This impacted Komeito’s performance in the 2024 House of Representatives election and the 2025 House of Councillors election, where it saw significant losses – a major blow to a party already facing an aging supporter base and declining strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Komeito’s true reason for withdrawal was likely that it judged it impossible to maintain the coalition when Takaichi became LDP president. Komeito leader Saito has repeatedly made statements suggesting they would &lt;a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA1133U0R11C25A0000000/"&gt;return to the coalition under the next president&lt;/a&gt;, implying that anyone but Takaichi would have continued to enjoy their support. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komeito has historically appealed to pacifist, liberal-minded supporters, presenting itself as a check on the LDP security policies. The concern was likely that under Takaichi, this restraint would cease to function &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; Takaichi is described as a hawk on security issues and has previously visited the Yasukuni shrine which honours Japanese war dead. (Prime Minister Abe’s 2013 visit to the shrine angered China and South Korea).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Departure from pacifism due to generational change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in Japan’s coalition politics can be attributed in part to changing social norms. Traditionally, older generations, who retain memories of the Second World War, have regarded Japan’s pacifist constitution as a national imperative, opposing measures like strengthening the country’s Self-Defense Forces. Such voters traditionally backed peace-oriented parties like Komeito and the Constitutional Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for younger generations who have fading or no memories of war, the perspective is very different. Many feel threatened by China’s military rise and North Korea’s missiles. Events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the re-election of President Donald Trump in the US have eroded their trust in an international order based on the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A strong ally has emerged as a new coalition partner: The Japan Innovation Party (Ishin)…a libertarian party aspiring to smaller central government.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More voters believe &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/asia-pacific/japan" title="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; should strengthen its national capabilities, &lt;a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/03/poll-japanese-support-for-self-defense-forces-rises-to-record-high/"&gt;including its military&lt;/a&gt;, or risk being dominated by foreign powers. Domestically, migration is an increasingly important issue, fuelling discontent and feeding support for right wing parties.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dynamic underpinned the breakthrough of the far-right Sanseito party, which campaigned on a ‘Japanese First’ platform in July’s House of Councillors election. It also led the overwhelming majority of LDP members to support Takaichi’s leadership bid in an effort to hold off the Sanseito challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coalition with Ishin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for Takaichi, a strong ally has emerged as a new coalition partner: The Japan Innovation Party (Ishin). This coalition will be just two seats short of a majority in the House of Representatives and five short in the House of Councillors. While still a minority government, this significantly increases the administration’s stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ishin is a political party founded with the goal of expanding the Osaka Restoration Party nationwide. Its policies centre on the Osaka sub-capital concept, aiming to resolve the excessive concentration of power in Tokyo, and on eliminating administrative inefficiencies through the Osaka Metropolitan Plan. This reflects its character as a libertarian party aspiring to smaller central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ishin presented twelve demands but identified three as minimum requirements: a proposal to make Osaka Japan’s secondary capital; social security reform; and a 10 per cent reduction in the number of Diet members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;

        &lt;svg class="icon icon--open-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
          &lt;use xlink:href="#icon-open-quote" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The LDP-Ishin coalition increases the likelihood that Japan will pursue more proactive foreign and security policies than before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secondary Capital proposal requires complex administrative measures and is a long-term issue, presenting few immediate problems for the LDP. Social security reform poses more significant challenges, as the LDP has significant elderly support and has allowed social security-related budgets to grow steadily. But Ishin is not expected to pursue radical policies on this point, planning instead to address it as a long-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue is reducing the number of Diet seats. The LDP already signed an agreement with the ruling Democratic Party in 2012 to reduce seats – but, the effort stalled due to opposition from within the LDP. Consequently, the Ishin demand is also highly unlikely to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ishin’s inclusion of seat reduction as a coalition condition was largely intended to test how seriously the LDP views the coalition and showcase Ishin’s libertarian policy of reducing administrative waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foreign and security policy of the coalition government&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LDP–Ishin coalition increases the likelihood that Japan will pursue more proactive foreign and security policies than before. Previously, the LDP’s coalition with Komeito imposed constraints on ambitions to enhance Japan’s capabilities. Dissolving that coalition removes them. Ishin holds a more hawkish stance on foreign and security policy than the LDP and aligns closely with the international outlook of Prime Minister Takaichi.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/sanae-takaichi-sees-herself-successor-shinzo-abe-changes-japans-politics-present-big</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 14:39:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The rise of Reform, the AfD and RN is more than a blip – so what happens if the E3 goes far right?</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/rise-reform-afd-and-rn-more-blip-so-what-happens-if-e3-goes-far-right</link><description>&lt;span&gt;The rise of Reform, the AfD and RN is more than a blip – so what happens if the E3 goes far right?&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The self-destruction of the traditional right represents a massive upheaval of Europe’s post-war political landscape. But a populist axis between the UK, France and Germany is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When Andrej Babiš &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62qezmr92lo"&gt;swept back into power&lt;/a&gt; last Sunday, it may at first have seemed like another mere blip in a continent that has long grown accustomed to populists coming and going. Yet, there might be more to Babiš’s comeback than meets the eye. To borrow Churchill’s phrasing, it may not be the beginning of the end, but ‘the end of the beginning’ for Europe’s anti-establishment right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, nationalist movements have gnawed at the edges of Europe’s political mainstream, railing against rootless and out-of-touch elites, Brussels, and globalism &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; while remaining excluded from real power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little now seems to remain of the ‘cordon sanitaire’ that had thus far kept populist parties at bay. With the shrinking of the centre and the emergence of a new generation of voters &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; for whom an anti-fascist narrative sounds like a vague abstraction &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; Europe’s populists may have come to maturity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Moving from the periphery to the centre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere might this be more consequential than where it matters most: in Europe’s political core. In Germany, the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has moved from peripheral protest to the country’s main structural political force, shaping the national agenda on migration, energy and the debt brake &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/afd-surges-in-german-polls-as-mainstream-parties-struggle/a-69387452"&gt;leading in the polls&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/france" title="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National (RN) has shed its talk of ‘Frexit’ and rebranded itself as the party of sovereignty without rupture &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;a nationalist alternative to both Macronism and Brussels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in Britain, Reform UK has morphed into the gravitational centre of the disoriented right, absorbing fragments of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/britains-conservative-party-heads-for-extinction-7e2e10a0"&gt;a once-dominant conservative tradition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question, then, is no longer whether populism will reach Berlin, London and Paris (the so-called E3). It is: what would happen to &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/topics/european-union-eu" title="European Union (EU)"&gt;the European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU) and to Europe as a geopolitical bloc if all three parties &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; AfD, National Rally, and Reform UK &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; were to hold power at more or less the same time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electoral calendar would technically make this possible. How would such a configuration affect the coherence of European economic integration and the stability of the euro? And, perhaps more importantly: what would the implications be for an already well-shaken NATO, and Europe’s commitment to Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would not necessarily herald a coherent alliance of sovereigntists. Politically, it would likely produce a continent of parallel nationalisms moving unevenly in the same direction. It would be a Europe defined less by unity or rupture than by a slow drift of purpose, in which the disoriented right finds itself somehow back in command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new centre of gravity for the disoriented right&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the increasing electoral appeal of the populist right can be attributed to the loss of the traditional centre right’s coordinates. What was once a broad coalition of Christian Democrats, Gaullists, Conservatives and free marketeers has fragmented under the depressurization of globalization, accelerating cultural insecurity and growing internal political contradictions over Europe itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Britain, France and Germany, this transformation has followed a similar pattern. The populists did not overthrow the old right; they inherited its electorate while discarding its inhibitions (‘the uninhibited right’ said an old slogan of the French Les Républicains aiming at winning back voters lost to Le Pen).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have learned to present themselves not as radicals but as realists &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; or what Monsieur Bardella, Le Pen’s heir apparent, calls ‘le bon sens’, the common sense. Be it in Berlin, London, or Paris, theirs is a politics of candour as authenticity &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; a narrative in which anger becomes proof of sincerity. Has a certain Donald J.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/germany" title="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the AfD draws much of its support from voters who once formed the CDU’s socially conservative base. In France, Marine Le Pen’s movement has captured the working- and lower-middle-class electorate that once sustained the Gaullist movement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in Britain, Reform UK has become a gravitational field for former Conservatives who see a purer expression of their own frustrations in Nigel Farage’s rhetoric &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;a trend reflected by the rising number of &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/sixteen-tory-councillors-defect-to-reform-this-morning-13446384"&gt;defections of Tory elected officials to Reform UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift has redrawn the boundaries of what counts as the political centre. And there lies perhaps the most significant institutional impact of the populist advance across the E3, one that will have far-reaching repercussions for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fault lines in a seeming unity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prospect of the AfD, National Rally, and Reform UK all holding power within a similar political window invites speculation that a populist axis may form, running through Europe’s three major economies. Yet such an alignment is politically unlikely – and chemically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first obstacle is structural: the United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU, which sharply limits any institutional convergence. Reform UK’s emerging base overlaps increasingly with disillusioned Conservatives and elements of the pro-business right &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; circles more concerned with regulatory flexibility than with continental confrontation. And as the &lt;a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/reform-uk"&gt;Institute for Government recently noted&lt;/a&gt;, the party’s economic instincts are Thatcherite rather than revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/rise-reform-afd-and-rn-more-blip-so-what-happens-if-e3-goes-far-right</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 15:06:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Recognition of Palestine can be more than symbolic if Europe and Gulf states remain aligned</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/09/recognition-palestine-can-be-more-symbolic-if-europe-and-gulf-states-remain-aligned</link><description>&lt;span&gt;Recognition of Palestine can be more than symbolic if Europe and Gulf states remain aligned&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;European countries like France are seeking a more assertive Middle East policy. Gulf countries have new unity after Israel’s strikes on Doha. Together they might yet progress Palestinian statehood.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Advocates for the two-state solution could be forgiven for thinking that recognition of Palestine by France, the UK, Canada, Australia and others this week will just lead to yet another dead-end for Palestinian statehood. Israel will continue its war in Gaza. It will also likely &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS/STATE-WESTBANK/gkvlaejbwpb/"&gt;build new settlements and expand existing ones&lt;/a&gt; in the West Bank, in essence annexing territory without formally doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that respect, it is easy for cynics from all sides of the spectrum to dismiss Western states’ recognition of Palestine as symbolic, a form of political theatre or (as charged by US President Donald Trump) an act that rewards Hamas for acts of terrorism against Israel. However, it would be a mistake to overlook the importance of the moment and the opportunity it presents for Arab and European states to build a new momentum towards Palestinian statehood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building international pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month has seen a remarkable series of events that would have been unimaginable until very recently:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 12 September 142 countries endorsed the New York Declaration – a French-Saudi led plan for a sovereign Palestinian state. On Sunday 21 September, Canada, Australia and &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/09/uk-recognition-palestine-will-it-make-any-difference" title="UK recognition of Palestine: Will it make any difference?"&gt;the UK recognized Palestine&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/22/israel-palestine-two-state-solution-summit-to-be-held-as-recognitions-surge"&gt;France and Saudi Arabia co-hosted a summit&lt;/a&gt; at UN headquarters, one day before the opening of the General Assembly’s general debate. The summit, the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, was boycotted by Israel and the US. But it brought together over 140 world leaders and diplomats to galvanize support for Palestinian statehood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French President Emmanuel Macron formally recognized the state of Palestine during his address, declaring that ‘the time for peace has come’ and urging an end to the war in Gaza, the release of hostages, and the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan repeated Macron’s call, urging all nations to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 24 September, France and the UK presented &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b86fb491-66a7-4cfd-aa89-1f885620f171"&gt;a European-led eight point ‘day after plan’&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;to the US administration and Arab allies, in which France has stated its willingness to contribute to an international stabilization mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These events represent an extraordinary shift among US allies on a previously immovable policy area. And several factors suggest that European and Gulf Cooperation Council countries could build on this moment to change the prospects of an independent Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The changing world worder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, European leaders want to play a more prominent role in the Middle East. The world order is changing, and Europe is under increasing diplomatic, economic and military pressure, compelling it to define its place in the emerging order. At present, it remains at the margins of influencing major political outcomes and is still beholden to &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/americas/united-states-america" title="United States of America"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; – as demonstrated by Trump’s dominant influence over the Russia–Ukraine war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Israel’s 9 September strike in Qatar on has been a significant catalyst for change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences with Trump’s administration have helped some European leaders recognize the need to step up and become more assertive and influential – proving the continent’s enduring relevance to the world, and especially the Middle East. It is unsurprising that &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/france" title="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, the EU’s only nuclear power and UN Security Council member, has taken the lead in working closely with Saudi Arabia on the New York Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe’s leaders are also driven by domestic pressures. Support for Israel appears to be &lt;a href="https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/52279-net-favourability-towards-israel-reaches-new-lows-in-key-western-european-countries"&gt;declining sharply in Western Europe&lt;/a&gt;. Many citizens are shocked by the scale and direction of Israel’s response to Hamas’s horrific cross-border attacks of October 2023, with a growing outcry over the &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/video/20250920-over-65-000-palestinians-killed-in-gaza-troops-press-assault-with-tanks-and-drones"&gt;65,000 Palestinians killed&lt;/a&gt; in Gaza.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed Israel seems to be losing in the broader Western court of public opinion. In earlier rounds of conflict, such as the &lt;a href="https://imeu.org/resources/resources/explainer-the-first-intifada/240"&gt;first and second intifada&lt;/a&gt; (1987 and 2000), Israel always held the prevailing narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time the competition over the narrative is very different; not because the Palestinians are winning it, but because Israel is losing it.

&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s new climate plan announced at the UN General Assembly has a disappointing headline target – but Beijing is likely to over-deliver, and it’s in its interest to place low-carbon development at the centre of its push for a new international order.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;International climate politics is in flux. The United States is, once again, withdrawing from global climate efforts. In &lt;a href="https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1n/k1n593x637"&gt;his address&lt;/a&gt; to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on 23 September, President Donald Trump called climate change the greatest ‘con job ever perpetrated on the world’ while advising the world leaders watching that ‘if you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.’&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the EU has managed to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-climate-clout-melts-away-china-target/"&gt;erode its own diplomatic influence&lt;/a&gt; in the run-up to COP30 by &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-paris-climate-accord-un-deadline-new-target/"&gt;failing to submit&lt;/a&gt; its national climate plan (Nationally Determined Contribution, NDC) on time, as member states were unable to agree on the extent of emissions reductions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, presented a non-binding &lt;a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-12986-2025-INIT/en/pdf"&gt;‘statement of intent’&lt;/a&gt; at a special High-Level Event on NDCs hosted by the UN Secretary General on 24 September. This only provided an indication of what emission reduction target the EU might eventually adopt, rather than the done deal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in this context – with the US out and the EU divided – that President Xi Jinping &lt;a href="https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k12/k12ebey0bu"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; China’s new NDC via video at UNGA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Under-promise and over-deliver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headline target of China’s new climate plan is to reduce economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by 7–10 per cent by 2035 compared to &lt;a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-09-25/Full-text-Xi-Jinping-s-video-speech-at-the-UN-Climate-Summit-2025-1GWpEelOnL2/p.html"&gt;‘peak levels’.&lt;/a&gt; This is concerning. To align with the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement, assessments suggest China needed to target cutting emissions by &lt;a href="https://dialogue.earth/en/climate/chinas-2035-targets-can-be-a-climate-breakthrough/"&gt;at least 30 per cent&lt;/a&gt; by 2035. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is the world’s largest emitter, accounting for &lt;a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2025"&gt;nearly a third&lt;/a&gt; of global greenhouse gas emissions. The yawning gap between what its government is willing to commit to, and what the Paris Agreement requires, therefore adds to widespread fears that the world is irrevocably headed for catastrophic climate change. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;aside&gt;
  &lt;figure class="media media-embed media-callout"&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="media__wrapper"&gt;
                &lt;span class="h1"&gt;7–10%&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;is the target amount by which China has pledged to&lt;span&gt; reduce economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;2035.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, China &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2025/09/18/dont-fret-over-chinas-new-climate-targets"&gt;has a track record&lt;/a&gt; of under-promising and over-delivering on its international climate targets. In much of the rest of the world, the opposite is true. The emissions reduction pledge should be understood as a floor, and not a ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably more important than the target, which constitutes a political signal as much as a scientific forecast, is what is happening on the ground. China is rapidly increasing renewable energy supply and replacing products and services which use fossil fuels with electric alternatives. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2024, about one in two new cars &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2025/trends-in-electric-car-markets-2"&gt;sold in China&lt;/a&gt; is electric, compared to about one in five in Europe. Wind and solar generating capacity &lt;a href="https://ember-energy.org/data/electricity-data-explorer/?data=capacity&amp;amp;fuel=wind_and_solar&amp;amp;entity=China"&gt;almost doubled&lt;/a&gt; between 2022 and 2024. As of July 2025, &lt;a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/report/chinas-solar-and-onshore-wind-capacity-reaches-new-heights-while-offshore-wind-shows-promise/"&gt;three in every four&lt;/a&gt; wind and solar projects under construction across the world are in China.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing boom gives legitimate hope that China will continue to outperform its targets and play a defining role in steering the world away from the worst ravages of climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Towards a ‘green’ international order?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just climate politics that’s in flux: the entire international order is being reshaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many shifts predate the second Trump administration, its &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/08/flux-president-trumps-trade-and-foreign-policy-new-normal-can-world-leaders-regain-some" title="Flux in President Trump’s trade and foreign policy is the new normal.

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Climate change – and how major powers respond to it – is likely to be one of the central factors shaping the new order.&lt;/p&gt;

China is the &lt;a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/china-energy-transition-review-2025/"&gt;leading manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; across the clean technology spectrum globally, producing &lt;a href="https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/publications/studies/photovoltaics-report.html"&gt;about 80 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of all solar panels and &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2025/trends-in-the-electric-car-industry-3"&gt;more than 70 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of all electric vehicles in 2024, with Europe and the United States lagging far behind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s solar panel exports have tripled in five years, hitting &lt;a href="https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/09/China-Energy-Transition-Review-2025.pdf"&gt;242 GW in 2024,&lt;/a&gt; only slightly under the total electricity generating capacity of &lt;a href="https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/EN/Areas/Energy/SecurityOfSupply/GeneratingCapacity/PowerPlantList/start.html"&gt;Germany.&lt;/a&gt; Half of this is destined for non-OECD countries, where clean tech products are expanding energy access, as seen across &lt;a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/the-first-evidence-of-a-take-off-in-solar-in-africa/"&gt;sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;/a&gt; and providing protection against surging prices, as &lt;a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/pakistan-solar-boom"&gt;in Pakistan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharp increases in &lt;a href="http://stats.customs.gov.cn/indexEn"&gt;imports of electric vehicles manufactured in China&lt;/a&gt; have also been seen in high-income and upper-middle income countries. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/09/new-international-order-forming-will-china-make-it-green</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 13:45:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Statesmen's Forum: Wang Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, PRC</title><link>https://www.csis.org/events/statesmens-forum-wang-yi-minister-foreign-affairs-prc</link><description>&lt;span&gt;Statesmen's Forum: Wang Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, PRC&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chafing at China’s assertiveness and US unpredictability, the UK and Europe would be wise to pursue their own truly independent China policies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping’s meeting this week comes at a moment of renewed economic confrontation and enduring mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports of a ‘positive framework’ covering tariff reprieves, China’s purchase of American soybeans, fentanyl cooperation, and rare earth export controls may build a fragile floor under the fraught relationship. But even a successful deal offers little scaffolding on which to shore up the structural foundations of this rivalry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond lofty stakes for the superpowers, the meeting holds significance for America’s partners, who are already recalibrating their strategies. For them the meeting reiterates the need to pursue independent strategies to manage long-term turbulence – whether the US and &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/asia-pacific/china" title="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; ultimately reach an enduring bargain, muddle through, or heighten confrontation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Vacillating between hawkish barbs and placatory rollbacks, the approach reveals a pattern of expediency&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since January, the US administration has pursued short-term measures towards Beijing, grabbing headlines but lacking a broader strategy. A February tariff blitz yielded a mutual climbdown and extended truce. Washington tightened semiconductor export controls, only to greenlight certain Nvidia sales. And Trump postponed a legally mandated ban of TikTok in favour of a commercial solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior US officials are also divided in their outlooks, with pro-tariff economic nationalists, market-oriented dealmakers and security hardliners vying for influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vacillating between hawkish barbs and placatory rollbacks, the approach reveals a pattern of expediency that often catches foreign capitals by surprise, even as they struggle to manage their own relationships with the US.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;A range of outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ‘grand bargain’ that addresses the greatest bilateral challenges – from Taiwan to the South China Sea to technology – is ostensibly appealing because it would limit uncertainty. But it seems &lt;a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/fantasy-grand-bargain-between-america-and-china"&gt;unlikely&lt;/a&gt;, given &lt;a href="https://asiasociety.org/sites/default/files/2023-12/ASPI%20CCA%20The%20New%20Domestic%20Politics%20of%20U.S.-China%20Relations.pdf"&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt; political space and&lt;a href=""&gt; structural rivalry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations could also collapse, escalating conflict and inflicting global economic damage. Both sides have honed coercive tools, with China learning from US innovations; its recent rare-earth export controls, which extend to ubiquitous inputs and processing technology, illustrate Beijing’s sweeping leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Policymakers in global capitals have long feared a forced choice between Beijing and Washington&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more likely outcome is continuity: a cycle of escalation and de-escalation. In this base case, any relative US &lt;a href="https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/23/how-china-is-outperforming-the-united-states-in-critical-technologies/?utm"&gt;advantage&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/06/testing-self-reliance-what-the-trade-war-reveals-about.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;wane&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite enduring American strengths – including in innovation and finance – China’s industrial capacity and relentless focus on cutting-edge sectors are formidable, especially considering funding cuts to American research. And US economic headwinds – from agricultural export losses to supply chain challenges and tariff uncertainty – may incentivize the pyrrhic embrace of short-term reprieves as strategic victories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Global consequences&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policymakers in global capitals have long feared a forced choice between Beijing and Washington. Since January, US partners and allies have scrambled to adapt and hedge in the face of China’s assertiveness and the US’s unpredictability. Recent months have heightened anxiety that partners’ interests will be subordinated to American commercial outcomes &amp;nbsp;– echoing a &lt;a href="https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-phase-one-tracker-chinas-purchases-us-goods"&gt;‘Phase One’&lt;/a&gt; agreement that prioritised commodity sales over structural irritants, and mirrored in current export control carveouts for US firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has largely pursued a bilateral approach to China, rather than collaborate with partners, with limited exceptions such as a recent critical mineral agreement with Australia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even under a more consultative Biden administration, allies chafed at the pressures of American economic security and industrial policy, like chip and green technology subsidies. Still, for partners, navigating difficult trade-offs on discrete issues is a different matter from acquiescing to an American partner lacking a cohesive strategy. &amp;nbsp;Whether the longer-term US trajectory favours the Trump or Biden models – or a different approach entirely – &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/united-kingdom" title="United Kingdom"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; and Europe would be wise to pursue their own truly independent China policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-center embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Chatham House field research on three continents reveals a common thread: pragmatic adaptation to defend national interests&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reorientation has already begun. Chatham House field research on three continents reveals a common thread: pragmatic adaptation to defend national interests and hedge against unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe has belatedly sought to ‘Trump-proof’ through boosting defence investment, strengthening economic security mechanisms, and diversifying trade, including negotiations with certain Latin American countries. The UK is likewise diversifying trade – resuming talks with China and striking a deal with India. At the same time, it is advancing an economic security strategy and selective alignment with Washington on technology, even as it resists pressure on digital services taxation and content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Asia and the Americas, too, partners are hedging. Japan and South Korea continue to embrace security cooperation with the US, but maintain substantial trade with China. Mexico has leveraged USMCA access to mitigate trade fallout, but remains heavily exposed. And Brazil, facing punitive tariffs, looks to Beijing to offload commodity exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Trump and Xi reach an agreement, partners may still face pressure from &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/americas/united-states-america" title="United States of America"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; to sharpen their policies toward China, often at significant economic cost – making autonomy even more desirable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, some states enjoy more latitude than others. Those that rely most on the US – whether for trade and investment or security guarantees – may feel more constrained. Pressures to align around advanced technology and artificial intelligence – where the US and China far outstrip others and barriers to competing are immense – can push countries like the UK into closer alignment. In some cases, managing dependency may be preferrable to missing out. And leaders must carefully navigate trade-offs rather than allow passivity to render them vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Planning for resilience &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure independence in a global system in which rules are deteriorating and dominant powers act transactionally, partners must move beyond rhetorical ‘de-risking’ to practical resilience. This includes economic security measures and coordination – from industrial policy to supply chains to investment screening. The EU’s Anti-Coercion Instrument, establishing penalties for boycotts and trade restrictions, is a promising start. Also the UK’s emphasis on economic security. But they must be sustained, and aligned with partners including like-minded nations in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/trump-and-xi-wont-reset-china-us-rivalry-so-other-nations-must-prepare</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:24:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The race for Greenland’s rare earth minerals is heating up.

  &lt;p&gt;The UK should coordinate with European partners and local communities to prioritize environmental safeguards while pursuing its strategic supply chain goals.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Last week, the UK government announced fresh trade negotiations with Greenland, the day after European leaders, including Keir Starmer, gathered in Copenhagen for the European Political Community Summit. Alongside talks over reducing tariffs on seafood imports, the British government said it &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-greenland-trade-deal-talks-resume"&gt;‘will seek to strengthen cooperation on critical minerals.’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK is entering a crowded field, with the US and the EU competing with China to access Greenland’s rare earths as they attempt to diversify away from Beijing’s dominance of the global critical minerals supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK’s best approach would be to cooperate closely with European partners, including Denmark. The EU has close relations with Greenland and has &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6166"&gt;already signed&lt;/a&gt; a partnership to develop its sustainable raw material value chains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the UK may want to secure critical minerals for its long-term supply chain needs, it should approach any mining ventures in Greenland within wider considerations of both Arctic security and the climate crisis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracting critical minerals without the right environmental safeguards risks causing further harm in a territory whose ice sheet is already rapidly melting, with disastrous results for the global climate. But if it prioritizes Indigenous rights and environmental safeguards, a UK-Greenland minerals trade deal has the potential to become a global benchmark for responsible sourcing. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Climate risks and geopolitics converging&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK-Greenland trade talks come as the territory finds itself at the crossroads of the climate crisis and geopolitical competition for resources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenland is warming faster than almost anywhere else on Earth. Latest data from the 2025 thawing period shows that Greenland is experiencing ongoing ice loss for its &lt;a href="https://eng.geus.dk/about/news/news-archive/2025/september/greenland-ice-sheet-massbalance-2025#:~:text=The%20Greenland%20Ice%20Sheet%20is%20shrinking%20for%20the%2029th%20year%20in%20a%20row."&gt;29th consecutive year,&lt;/a&gt; with a significant increase in melting rates compared to the early 1990s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As global temperatures climb, the Greenland ice sheet is approaching a &lt;a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/4299/2020/"&gt;critical tipping point.&lt;/a&gt; Once this threshold is crossed, the ice sheet will no longer be able to fully recover. Further melting could trigger irreversible global sea-level rise of &lt;a href="https://nsidc.org/learn/parts-cryosphere/ice-sheets/why-ice-sheets-matter"&gt;more than seven metres,&lt;/a&gt; raising oceans and profoundly altering the world’s coastlines. This would put tens of millions of people in low-lying areas worldwide at risk, with far-reaching impacts on global security and migration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Economic ambitions need to be matched by coordinated approaches to climate security, emerging risks and long-term stability in a rapidly changing Arctic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The melting of Greenland’s ice sheet has also made its resources more accessible for extraction, drawing international attention. Greenland is home to largely untapped deposits of critical minerals. The Tanbreez project, Greenland’s most significant rare earth deposit, contains a mix of high-value, heavy rare-earths, zirconium and niobium deposits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, which has positioned itself an &lt;a href="https://english.www.gov.cn/archive/white_paper/2018/01/26/content_281476026660336.htm"&gt;‘important stakeholder’&lt;/a&gt; in the Arctic region, &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/04/chinas-rare-earth-export-restrictions-threaten-washingtons-military-primacy" title="China’s rare earth export restrictions threaten Washington’s military primacy"&gt;dominates global critical mineral supply chains.&lt;/a&gt; Chinese companies are already invested in developing Greenland’s resources, for example Shenghe Resource’s development of the &lt;a href="https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2020/presence-before-power/4-greenland-what-is-china-doing-there-and-why/"&gt;Kvanefjeld project in 2019.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others, notably the US and EU, have also looked to Greenland’s resources as they seek to diversify their mineral supply chains. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in annexing Greenland, which he said the US &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/04/world/greenland-annexation-threat-trump-nbc-interview-intl-hnk"&gt;needs ‘for international security.’&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaining access to Greenland’s mineral resources would be in line with the Trump administration’s drive to &lt;a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-trumps-new-critical-minerals-executive-order"&gt;secure critical minerals&lt;/a&gt; as a national security imperative. Earlier this year, the concession of the Tanbreez project was sold to &lt;a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/news/us-officials-greenland-rare-earths/?cf-view"&gt;New York-based Critical Metals Corp.&lt;/a&gt; This came after the US and Denmark &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-lobbied-greenland-rare-earths-developer-tanbreez-not-sell-china-2025-01-09/"&gt;reportedly lobbied&lt;/a&gt; for it to not be sold to a Chinese company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The UK will need to coordinate closely with European partners, especially Denmark and the other Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the interest from China and the US, Greenland’s closest partner is the EU. In a speech to the European Parliament on Wednesday, Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen described the bloc as a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-greenland-trump-denmark-nielsen-50a4008469e1a073454f4e7cc0ccbe05"&gt;‘stable, reliable and important partner.’&lt;/a&gt; He urged it to invest in Greenland’s mineral resources among other sectors, which would build on the existing strategic partnership &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/document/print/en/ip_23_6166/IP_23_6166_EN.pdf"&gt;signed in 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the EU’s close relations with Greenland, the UK will need to coordinate closely with European partners, especially Denmark and the other Nordic countries, to avoid the perception of competing against Europe for access to minerals. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with Europe will also help the UK avoid reliance on Chinese supply chains for refining rare earths. Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.oxfordenergy.org/publications/chinas-rare-earths-dominance-and-policy-responses/"&gt;almost all refining capacity&lt;/a&gt; for rare earth metals is in China. The UK does not have rare earth metal processing capacity, but Europe has two rare earth processing facilities (in Estonia and in France).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The need for environmental safeguards&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UK-Greenland minerals trade deal offers a unique opportunity to establish high environmental and social standards that could set a global benchmark for future mineral trade partnerships. Rare earth mining involves toxic chemicals and can produce radioactive waste, making strong environmental safeguards essential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenland’s government and communities will also be scrutinizing the environmental impact of any deal. After the Inuit Ataqatigiit party came to power in 2021, the Greenland government &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/05/greenland-mining-energy-transition-minerals-environmental-laws-uranium-rare-earth-toxic-waste-investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-aoe#:~:text=When%20it%20took%20power%2C%20the,in%20violation%20of%20the%20law."&gt;stopped a uranium mining project&lt;/a&gt; in the Kvanefjeld project over ecological and social concerns. Any new deal must avoid repeating past mistakes of disregarding these concerns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="media__content"&gt;
        &lt;svg class="icon icon--open-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
          &lt;use xlink:href="#icon-open-quote" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Arctic is emerging as a strategic region where resource security, climate policy and geopolitics increasingly intersect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK-Greenland deal should also include requirements to monitor the conditions under which minerals are extracted and processed, including via satellites and by local communities. This will be essential to detect pollution or other harmful environmental impacts, especially on water resources and the marine environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measures will strengthen accountability and align a potential deal with emerging European and global standards for responsible sourcing and supply chain traceability, while also supporting the transition to a more circular economy of minerals and metals. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/race-greenlands-rare-earth-minerals-heating-uk-should-work-europe-sustainable-strategy</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 10:56:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The TikTok transfer raises worrying questions for allies like the UK</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/tiktok-transfer-raises-worrying-questions-allies-uk</link><description>&lt;span&gt;The TikTok transfer raises worrying questions for allies like the UK&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The US takeover may allay fears of Chinese influence. But it sends a worrying signal to allies who are increasingly dependent on US technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class="media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image"&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent surrounded by journalists and microphones as he answers questions following China trade talks" height="630" src="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2025-10/2025-10-03-scott-bessent-2235058331.jpg?itok=Ilo4bdcD" width="1200" /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Social media app TikTok has secured a lifeline in the United States after years of hearings, regulatory battles and high-level talks between US and Chinese officials. A complex restructuring that transfers majority control to US is underway, with investors including technology company Oracle, investment firm Silver Lake, and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corp.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; certified the pending agreement as a ‘qualified divestiture’, legalizing the social media platform again by removing it from foreign adversary control (in this case, China).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, led by US tech giant, Oracle, gives American companies approximately &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/25/trump-china-tiktok-deal"&gt;65 per cent ownership&lt;/a&gt; of TikTok’s US operations, while ByteDance and other Chinese investors retain less than 20 per cent. As part of the new group of owners, Oracle will provide US cloud services and data storage in the US, and apparently receive &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/22/tech/tiktok-sale-oracle-algorithm"&gt;a licensed copy of the app’s algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This US transfer is a significant shift in the company’s operations and an on-paper win for President Trump’s White House. But the optics mask a harsher truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deeply rooted issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imposing majority US ownership – and going ‘American-operated all the way’ – is a big step. But it is by no means a silver bullet to address the threats TikTok, and similar platforms, present to US democracy and national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;aside&gt;
  &lt;figure class="media media-embed media-callout"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal has been framed as a major win for US technology sovereignty. Operating a US-licensed algorithm and storing user data on American soil might allay anxieties about potential Chinese Communist Party influence over the app’s American users. But long-standing problems remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendation algorithms of social media platforms have political power. &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14614448251339755"&gt;Research indicates&lt;/a&gt; that their design can result in polarization by creating echo chambers. This can limit political dialogue and a diversity of views.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TikTok’s ‘For You’ function provides hyper-personalized content that is highly effective in maximizing user engagement. That has been good for business: the US firm will be valued at approximately $14 billion, with &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/09/25/1-in-5-americans-now-regularly-get-news-on-tiktok-up-sharply-from-2020/"&gt;63 per cent of US teenagers reporting use of the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile 1 in 5 American adults regularly get their news from TikTok – a leap from 2020. The new US owners are unlikely to fundamentally change how TikTok’s recommendation algorithm works. The truth is an uncomfortable one, but long-known: what is bad for inclusive and secure online information spaces is often good for business.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="h5 teaser__title"&gt;&lt;span&gt;US ownership of TikTok won’t protect democracies from digital threats&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, experts and policymakers have warned that TikTok could be weaponized as a political tool. That risk assessment initially focused on claims about China’s access to TikTok user data, and the possibility the platform could be manipulated to spread disinformation and for political interference.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the lens has shifted to focus on TikTok’s potential manipulation by US political actors. Announcing the deal, President Trump himself said ‘if I could, I’d make it 100 per cent MAGA-related’, though he went on to add that&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640745/tiktok-deal-trump-us-china-bytedance"&gt; every group would be treated fairly&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it is unclear how the Trump administration will work with the seven members of US TikTok’s new board of directors. And it remains to be seen if and how the board will address the widely used platform’s existing flaws: TikTok is already a hotbed for mis- and disinformation, and &lt;a href="https://ecfr.eu/article/disinformation-for-beginners-how-access-to-tiktok-is-threatening-european-security/"&gt;not just in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;US control over TikTok is not a fix-all for vulnerabilities in its fragile and divisive information environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app’s new US owners may consider changes to US TikTok’s content moderation policies. But that could also be cause for concern. There is a risk that sidelining or deprioritizing efforts to moderate problematic content would further pollute an already volatile information space. Changes to rework content moderation on Twitter, now X, since Elon Musk’s takeover have been &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/06/inside-elon-musk-x-twitter-austin-content-moderation/"&gt;the subject of much criticism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, US control over TikTok is not a fix-all for vulnerabilities in its fragile and divisive information environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond TikTok&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s executive order was released following US–China talks in which control over TikTok has been leveraged as part of broader national security, economic and trade negotiations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having previously indicated that no deal was possible, China implied it felt coerced into deal-making in view of looming US tariffs. China’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang cited concerns of ‘unilateral bullying’, although some commentators have pointed out that &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/25/trump-signs-tiktok-order-to-give-time-to-wrap-proposed-deal-00581319"&gt;China might draw out the approval timeline&lt;/a&gt; for the deal, using the delay to gain advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/tiktok-transfer-raises-worrying-questions-allies-uk</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 09:23:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>I wrote the UK defence review: Britain must accelerate reform if it is to help guarantee Ukraine’s security</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/09/i-wrote-uk-defence-review-britain-must-accelerate-reform-if-it-help-guarantee-ukraines</link><description>&lt;span&gt;I wrote the UK defence review: Britain must accelerate reform if it is to help guarantee Ukraine’s security&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The SDR set out the steps to meet the UK’s responsibilities as part of the ‘coalition of the willing’. But time is short to make the necessary changes.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class="media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Two major features dominated UK defence and security in 2025: the publication of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in June and discussions, led by Britain and France, to form a ‘coalition of the willing’ to underpin a ceasefire or settlement in Ukraine. Both draw attention to the same imperative: the need for a transformation in UK defence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-strategic-defence-review-2025-making-britain-safer-secure-at-home-strong-abroad"&gt;The SDR&lt;/a&gt; described a world dominated by state-level confrontation and conflict, playing out amidst combinations of population growth, climate change, nuclear weapons proliferation, and the extraordinarily pervasive effects of the digital age.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contrasted the level of threat with the much-diminished potency of the UK armed forces. All three services were reduced in size, quality and readiness during the 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall – even accounting for the ‘War on Terror’ and commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="h5 teaser__title"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The SDR presents an opportunity for the UK to become a leader in space – if it is followed by urgent investment &lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing the review, my fellow authors and I concluded that restoring deterrence in this new era of major strategic risk could not be based upon rebuilding ‘traditional’ model forces.&amp;nbsp;With armed forces evolving at the speed of technological innovation, a new industrial partnership is required to make &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/united-kingdom" title="United Kingdom"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; ready for the modern battlefield. And it must arrive at speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent probes by drones and fighter aircraft into Polish and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nato-condemns-russia-estonian-airspace-violation-vows-defend-itself-2025-09-23/"&gt;Estonian airspace&lt;/a&gt; show that the Russian threat is urgent and applies across the continent of Europe – and that Moscow has every intention of testing &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/topics/north-atlantic-treaty-organization-nato" title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;’s defences and willingness to react.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK should progress reform at speed to meet the challenges ahead – particularly if it is to lead efforts to provide security guarantees for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ukraine’s lessons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody anticipated the current situation in the war in Ukraine, or how both sides have changed the way they fight. Russia is edging forward through a succession of very small gains at extraordinary cost in people and material. It has yet to show the ability to break through Ukraine’s defences or exploit such a gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-departments-and-programmes/russia-and-eurasia-programme/russias-war-ukraine" title="Russia’s war on Ukraine "&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; has strained every sinew to contain the Russian invasion to 20 per cent of its territory. It has also taken its fight to Russian held territory and to Russia itself, making innovative use of drones and missile technology to strike at &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/07/understanding-russias-black-sea-strategy" title="Understanding Russia’s Black Sea strategy"&gt;the Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; Fleet, Crimean bridges and oil installations among many other targets. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="media__content"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A ceasefire and possibly a settlement is becoming more likely, perhaps as soon as next year. That will demand that the UK provides the guarantees it has promised.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, despite a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/21/world/europe/ukraine-sumy-advances.html"&gt;recent counterattack in the Sumy region&lt;/a&gt;, Ukraine shows no sign of finding the people and equipment to field the offensive military capability necessary to take back its land – especially since US support has become so unpredictable under the administration of President Donald Trump. Neither does Kyiv have the willingness to absorb the great loss of people that would be involved.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that, one way or another, a ceasefire and possibly a settlement is becoming more likely, perhaps as soon as next year. That will demand that the UK provides the guarantees it has promised. But is it ready?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New technology for a new deterrence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settling matters in Ukraine is in Britain’s national interest because it is the very best way to establish the terms of a new security relationship to Russia for the whole of Europe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reverse is also true: failing to guarantee an outcome in Ukraine will create a much greater chance of Russia attacking again, either in Ukraine or elsewhere in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting Ukraine could catalyse the development of a more independent and resilient European defence over time. But it will not be easy: President Trump has made it clear that Europe will no longer receive the US subsidy it has relied on since 1949. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And European defence requires deterrence at the level of ‘escalation dominance’ – the creation of certainty in Russia’s mind that military opportunism will result in blows that far outweigh any putative gains. The ‘coalition of the willing’ has to find the strength of purpose necessary to underpin such an effort, outside the US-backed power of NATO. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/09/i-wrote-uk-defence-review-britain-must-accelerate-reform-if-it-help-guarantee-ukraines</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 11:37:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Members’ Question Time: Is NATO’s eastern flank battle-ready?</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/events/all/members-event/members-question-time-natos-eastern-flank-battle-ready</link><description>&lt;span&gt;Members’ Question Time: Is NATO’s eastern flank battle-ready?&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In recent weeks, Russian drones have crossed into NATO airspace, with incursions into Poland and Romania, and Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violating Estonian airspace, testing the Alliance’s resilience and preparedness. These provocations, alongside the Zapad exercises conducted in Belarus, have prompted NATO to launch Operation Eastern Sentry to strengthen forward defence and reassure eastern member states amid intensifying Russian pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, questions have been raised around the readiness of NATO forces on the ‘eastern flank’. As Europe continues to rearm, the threats to its eastern border appear to be at their most heightened in decades, with Russia escalating its hybrid activities across Europe and growing uncertainty over whether the United States will fully commit to defending NATO’s eastern flank under Article 5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Join us as Katja Bego, Senior Research Fellow for the International Security Programme, examines whether NATO’s eastern flank is prepared to respond to evolving threats, what these developments mean for deterrence and forward defence, and how the Alliance can maintain cohesion in the face of ongoing Russian pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:membersevents@chathamhouse.org"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Submit your questions to the experts&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;in advance of the event.

After a rigorous selection process, we are pleased to announce the winner of our 2025 prize, as well as the three articles which have made our shortlist for the 2025 prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has rarely been harder to launch a career in academia. The high expectations that PhD students and post-doctoral researchers face regarding teaching, course administration, outreach and, of course, research, have been well documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, we believe it is important to celebrate outstanding research produced by early career researchers. While the seniority of an author is not taken into account during the &lt;em&gt;International Affairs&lt;/em&gt; editorial process, looking back at the high quality articles written by early career academics has been an immensely rewarding exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The winner&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that the &lt;em&gt;International Affairs &lt;/em&gt;Early Career Prize 2025 goes to &lt;strong&gt;Sebastian Haug&lt;/strong&gt; for his article ‘&lt;strong&gt;Mutual legitimation attempts: the United Nations and China’s Belt and Road Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae020"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The shortlist&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following articles were shortlisted by the members of our editorial board.

Respected individuals: when state representatives wield outsize influence in international organizations&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Timon Forster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9fvSqMkuUsCkMBYHZ-Dgwg.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;States are keen to send representatives to international organizations, instructing them to pursue national interests and monitor staff. Yet academics tend to ignore these individuals and approximate state influence by vote shares and other state-level attributes. Against this background, I examine when state representatives in international organizations wield outsize influence on decision-making. Based on scholarship of bureaucrats in international organizations, European studies and an interdisciplinary literature on negotiation, I argue that state delegates matter beyond their national affiliation. Empirically, I study one especially powerful institution in global governance: the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Elite interviews with IMF state representatives demonstrate that delegates carefully plan their interventions, behaving independently while also extending their constituents’ interests. Based on the analysis of these interviews, I theorize ‘respected individuals’ to describe state representatives who can wield outsize influence on decision-making. Their prestige and impact depend on: first, perceived autonomy from their home governments; and second, relevant expertise, social skills and deliberative craft. In the IMF, respected individuals are most likely to represent relatively weak states; more generally, my work speaks to debates on the power of small states in international financial institutions and multilateral negotiations. Together, the findings explicate how individuals impact organizational decision-making, with important implications for practitioners in such institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiad226"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

While the BRI has unfolded as a global platform focused on bilateral relations, the Chinese government has also tried to expand links between the BRI and international organizations, notably the United Nations. Available evidence about UN–BRI relations suggests, however, that an initial honeymoon phase with mushrooming projects and public endorsements was followed by a sharp decline in engagement. This article argues that a focus on inter-governor legitimation attempts helps understand the rise and fall of UN–BRI relations. Based on publicly available evidence, internal documentation and stakeholder interviews, it shows how legitimation informed motivations on both sides to invest in UN–BRI relations, and how western opposition subsequently led to UN entities reducing their engagement. Empirically, the article contributes to the literature on China’s global role, evolving power relations at the UN, and the proliferation of geopolitically motivated flagship initiatives across UN member states. Conceptually, it speaks to the expanding debate about legitimation in world politics through a more systematic engagement with relational legitimation dynamics. A focus on one-sided or mutual legitimation attempts offers a conceptual tool for analysing how interactions among global governors and their audiences unfold, and how international organizations try (and fail) to strengthen their resilience in light of an increasingly polarized membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae020"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. The Russian factor: emotions, narratives and reshaping China’s norms in international conflicts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiaoyu Lu and Tinghao Zhang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0_nJHzElPzE0B9IWUTC0Ww.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;How did Russia, despite being in a weaker position, exercise a continuous and resilient influence on China’s normative approach to international conflicts from Syria to Ukraine? This article proposes a theoretical framework that connects the affective turn and norm studies in International Relations. It conceptualizes emotions as the affective infrastructure of norm scripts: shared political feelings create resonance, based on which persuasive narratives work to maintain solidarity and institutionalize normative changes. Drawing on primary Russian and Chinese resources and using process tracing to identify critical junctures in the partnership and institutional channels for Russian campaigns, this article demonstrates how China’s alignment with Russia is not solely based on geopolitical interests or constructed identities but rather a result of feelings of isolation and marginalization that firstly resonated with and then exploited by Russian actors. Furthermore, this article identifies three types of persuasive narratives used to construct continuity, analogy and identification in consolidating emotional resonance around the threat of a homogenous West and inducing normative convergence. This drives China to adopt policies in conflict with national interests and norms on sovereignty and territorial integrity that trigger a reflective assessment of the Russian influence, while underlining the growing importance of emotion diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae126"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information on International Affairs and how to submit your research, visit our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;website&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More information on the Early Career Prize and a list of the previous winners can be found &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/pages/early_career_prize"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All views expressed are individual not institutional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=42d1048ccee6" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/international-affairs-early-career-prize-2025-42d1048ccee6"&gt;International Affairs Early Career Prize 2025&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog"&gt;International Affairs Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/international-affairs-early-career-prize-2025-42d1048ccee6?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 15:01:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Top 5 books: January 2025</title><link>https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-5-books-january-2025-cfeb6622c665?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</link><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g2qFnA7t29K-y2TMYHjKbQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a better way to start the year than with a brand-new book? Yes, with a brand-new book that is unlikely to disappoint!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog, Book Reviews Editor Mariana presents five strong options from the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/issue/101/1"&gt;January 2025 issue&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Affairs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Explore a varied selection below that is certain to be of interest to anyone curious about the European Union, peace processes in Africa, embassies or the aesthetics of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Crises of European integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_XWJGCnbgRH_EOdSLi4LdQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Lucas Schramm. Published in London by Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Voting in Europe during 2025 promises major political shifts.’ If the predictions from &lt;em&gt;Euronews&lt;/em&gt; are to be taken seriously, then Lucas Schramm’s new book will prove an invaluable read for anyone interested in the wider implications for the European Union and its path towards integration. Schramm carefully examines eight different crises that the EU has faced in the last seven decades, bringing in a commendable empirical scope. With systematic nuance, the book identifies the different processes of change — from stagnation, adaptation and regression — associated with successive crises. Schramm’s conclusions might surprise those who believe Jean Monnet’s famous dictum that Europe ‘will be built through crises’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae299"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Securing peace in Angola and Mozambique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Pf3Ve7CZ95AI5WUM1f6nwg.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Miranda Melcher. Published in London by Bloomsbury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every so often, a debut book makes its way onto our list of recommendations: this unassuming monograph is certainly worth the attention of students and scholars of peace and conflict studies. Drawing on United Nations archives and original interviews with a variety of relevant actors, Miranda Melcher offers a comprehensive analysis of two complete peace processes to expand readers’ knowledge of how to negotiate and implement a peace treaty. There is ample merit in Melcher’s comparative approach, especially as the civil wars in Angola and Mozambique allow for a significant reflection on lessons learned, including the importance of a balance between specificity and flexibility in peace deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae294"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Outposts of diplomacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uAOJElfoPg0PEFn5Bi1DYA.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by G. R. Berridge. Published in London by Reaktion Books.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This entertaining and informative exploration of how embassies have developed over time, and of their persistent existence even in hostile environments, will provide a rare treat to a broad audience. G. R. Berridge successfully combines facts and anecdotes in a narrative that explores myriad themes, from embassy household politics to the negative connotations that diplomatic staff attributed to the ‘less honourable’ task of intelligence-gathering. As the book draws primarily on European and American diplomats’ experiences, its captivating storytelling calls for a sequel that delves into the perspectives of their global South counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae312"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) War and aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gFHYpKKeUEJJQ2tbNI3-YA.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jens Bjering, Anders Engberg-Pedersen, Solveig Gade and Christine Strandmose Toft. Published in Cambridge, MA by MIT Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This edited volume features an impressive line-up of contributors; it invites readers to reconsider the concepts of technology, surveillance and artificial intelligence to reveal the aesthetic dimension of warfare. In doing so, the book raises many important questions about the ways in which the representational field of war is constructed, while simultaneously bringing to the forefront how art can counter the logic of warfare. The chapters are intriguing and theoretically driven, without losing sight of the empirical details: from questions of poetry and war to reflections on the relationship between fabrics and choreography on the one hand and armed conflict on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae289"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) India’s energy revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Xm_I0EM5uQ9wxyl2Vlpbqw.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Annika Bose Styczynski. Published in Abingdon and New York by Routledge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While India is the third largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, the literature on its energy sector is sparse. Annika Bose Styczynski’s edited volume seeks to fill precisely this gap, focusing on the supply side of the country’s energy policies. Featuring 12 contributed chapters, the book investigates India’s energy sources and offers useful assessments regarding their individual contributions to the Indian economy. From the challenges of phasing out coal to the successes in onshore wind power and the shortcomings of making nuclear energy a significant energy output, this is a timely reminder of how India’s energy portfolio will influence global energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae302"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mariana Vieira is the Book Reviews Editor of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;International Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find the latest book reviews section in our January 2025 issue &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/issue/101/1#2087404-7942162"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more reading suggestions, check out the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/tagged/ia-bookshelf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IA Bookshelf series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are interested in reviewing a book for the journal, register your interest in our book review application form &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6ZOiHKZ2WYj8UEaaXy9-gVuv_0ONmB2x2pv1x9-VcSWwCdg/viewform"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and follow us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IAJournal_CH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;social media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; where we post regular call outs for specific books and experts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All views expressed are individual not institutional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=cfeb6622c665" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-5-books-january-2025-cfeb6622c665"&gt;Top 5 books: January 2025&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog"&gt;International Affairs Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-5-books-january-2025-cfeb6622c665?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 10:23:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Future of the Grid—A View from ARPA-E</title><link>https://www.csis.org/events/future-grid-view-arpa-e</link><description>&lt;span&gt;The Future of the Grid—A View from ARPA-E&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Escalating tensions between the world’s two largest nuclear powers come only months before the last remaining US–Russia nuclear arms control treaty expires.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Last week, Russia &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/recent-russian-nuclear-capable-weapons-testing/story?id=127024334"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have successfully tested two nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable weapons: the Burevestnik cruise missile and the Poseidon underwater drone. The announcement comes only months before the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the US is due to expire.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) places binding limits on the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems by the world’s two largest nuclear powers. It is due to expire in February 2026, risking the removal of the final guardrail restraining the size and visibility of their arsenals – and increasing the risk of a new nuclear arms race.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a time of deep geopolitical mistrust and diminished diplomatic capacity, preventing escalation and preserving even minimal restraint is an urgent priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Threats of nuclear testing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="h5 teaser__title"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How likely is the use of nuclear weapons by Russia?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s announcement has been widely interpreted in the West as evidence of rapid Russian nuclear modernization and has caused alarm among policymakers and media outlets. Moscow has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-nuclear-poseidon-drone-burevestnik-missile-6c0d55d4d1a56e60ce750f8abe5eccab"&gt;further stated&lt;/a&gt; that these new weapons are difficult to detect and capable of evading missile defences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is no independent verification of these tests or the operational readiness of either system. Both have been under development for years and have faced repeated setbacks. The systems are based on old Soviet designs that could never be made operational &amp;nbsp; due to technical challenges, raising significant questions about the authenticity of Moscow’s statements. The claims should therefore be understood, at least in part, as strategic signalling amid heightened nuclear posturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US response has further escalated tensions. After Russia’s announcement, President Trump &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115460423936412555"&gt;instructed the State Department&lt;/a&gt; to restart US nuclear testing ‘on an equal basis’ to other countries. This statement has created confusion: no nuclear-armed state other than North Korea has conducted a nuclear explosive test since the 1990s. The US Department of Energy &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-not-planning-nuclear-explosions-this-time-energy-secretary-says-2025-11-02/"&gt;has since clarified &lt;/a&gt;that the US will conduct ‘non-critical explosions’ that are not nuclear detonations, and &lt;a href="https://www.2news.com/news/local/u-s-senators-introduce-bill-requiring-approval-before-presidents-can-resume-nuclear-testing/article_230e9b15-3f40-421c-9af8-25aa3aa3f6c7.html"&gt;legislation has been introduced&lt;/a&gt; to prevent any president from authorizing such tests unilaterally. However, this ambiguity has already had consequences. Putin has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/putin-orders-proposals-resumption-nuclear-testing-2025-11-05/"&gt;ordered officials&lt;/a&gt; to draft proposals for resuming Russian nuclear testing, citing uncertainty over US intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="h5 teaser__title"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why America may be triggering a new era of nuclear proliferation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These developments threaten to collapse the three-decade long moratorium on nuclear tests. While a return to nuclear testing would not benefit the US – it already has the &lt;a href="https://www.americansecurityproject.org/the-u-s-doesnt-need-to-resume-nuclear-testing/"&gt;world’s largest archive&lt;/a&gt; of historical test data – other nuclear weapons states, particularly Russia and China, would stand to benefit more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the danger is not simply that nuclear testing might resume. It is the escalation of nuclear threats and messaging at a time when trust is at its lowest point in decades, eroding the fragile foundation that post-Cold War arms control has been built upon. This highlights how nuclear rhetoric is increasingly deployed as a tool of political coercion – and how quickly restraint can unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The uncertain future of New START&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this climate, the impending expiration of New START is of particular concern as it cannot legally be extended again under its existing terms. Although &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/russia-and-eurasia/russia" title="Russia: Current affairs and analysis"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; suspended its participation in the treaty in 2023, both Moscow and Washington have continued to observe the central numerical limits on deployed strategic warheads and delivery systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="h5 teaser__title"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As nuclear negotiations show, US bilateral deal-making is no substitute for multilateralism&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia has proposed a voluntary one-year extension whereby both countries mutually commit to continuing to observe these limits. Trump has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-putins-offer-nuclear-arms-control-sounds-like-good-idea-2025-10-05/"&gt;signalled openness&lt;/a&gt; to this idea, but no substantive progress has been made. Importantly, Russia’s claimed new delivery systems (if operational) would already fall under existing New START warhead and launcher limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his first term, Trump pushed for trilateral nuclear arms control negotiations with &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/asia-pacific/china" title="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, rather than advancing bilateral agreements. But involving China in negotiations around a New START extension should be avoided as it would risk stalling or sacrificing any progress altogether. Although China now has the world’s third largest nuclear arsenal, it remains significantly smaller than those of the US and Russia. China therefore has little incentive to accept constraints on its nuclear programme, meaning fruitful negotiations would be unlikely in the short term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If New START expires without even a symbolic extension, the consequences could be significant. The absence of mutually agreed constraints could fuel an arms race in which Russia and the &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/americas/united-states-america" title="United States of America"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; expand deployed nuclear arsenals, undermining strategic stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-center embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="media__content"&gt;
        &lt;svg class="icon icon--open-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
          &lt;use xlink:href="#icon-open-quote" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If New START expires without even a symbolic extension, the consequences could be significant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would weaken the credibility of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the main international treaty governing nuclear weapons. Many states already view nuclear weapons states as backsliding on their disarmament obligations. Abandoning the last bilateral nuclear arms control framework would reinforce that perception.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a one-year voluntary extension is not a long-term solution, it is likely the best available option in the current environment. Negotiating a new or more comprehensive treaty is unrealistic given geopolitical tensions, domestic political uncertainty in the US, and a weakened diplomatic and technical capacity within the US government, where &lt;a href="https://garamendi.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-garamendi-demands-answers-firings-nuclear-weapons-diplomats"&gt;key arms control posts remain unfilled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A strategy for stabilization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is needed now is not an ambitious new treaty framework, but a focused effort to preserve the minimum conditions needed for future progress. The first step should be for the US and Russia to agree to a one-year voluntary extension of New START’s central limits. Although this would not restore trust between the countries or halt nuclear modernization programmes already underway, it would prevent immediate further deterioration of the global arms control architecture and lower the risk of miscalculations. It would also signal shared recognition that unconstrained nuclear competition benefits no one.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/11/russia-and-us-put-nuclear-testing-back-table-time-running-out-arms-control</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 10:37:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Vulnerabilities in Sukhoi Production: Clipping Russia’s Wings</title><link>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/research-papers/vulnerabilities-sukhoi-production-clipping-russias-wings</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This research paper examines the critical vulnerabilities in the production of Russia’s Sukhoi combat aircraft and its implications for NATO and global defence markets.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/research-papers/vulnerabilities-sukhoi-production-clipping-russias-wings</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Poland’s policy on China: From partnership to skepticism</title><link>https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/polands-policy-on-china-from-partnership-to-skepticism/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Despite its traditionally transatlantic orientation, Poland pursued an engagement policy toward China until the late 2010s.

&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gulf leaders’ Oval Office access has never been so good. They and others invested in the peace plan must use constant visits to the president to keep up momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class="media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image"&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan speaks to President Donald Trump in Abu Dhabi on 15 May 2025." height="630" src="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2025-11/2025-11-07-trump-UAE-president-2214575311.jpg?itok=cdVbTott" width="1200" /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The success of US President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas rests on many factors. Not least is the president’s own level of engagement with the initiative. Should he lose focus or become distracted with another international issue – possibly believing that he has already ‘solved’ the Israel–Palestine conflict – then movement towards phase two will falter. Israel and Hamas will recommence the same punishing cycle of violence that has killed so many Palestinians and Israelis. And a process toward Palestinian statehood will not progress. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world has come to learn that President Trump’s governing style is unpredictable and intensely personal. He values being the centre of attention, enjoys the sensation of success and being seen as the world’s greatest dealmaker. He is undoubtedly a challenging president to engage. Yet some world leaders, particularly those from the Gulf and Europe, have developed the means to capture his attention. In doing so, they have become adept at managing relations with him. They have become Trump ‘whisperers’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="media__content"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;If Gulf and European leaders can capitalize upon…privileged access to the US president and keep him feeling central to events, then the Gaza plan has a chance of advancing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ), Qatari Emir Tamim Al-Thani, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Hungarian President Viktor Orban. All have learned to manage Trump by understanding not only what serves his interests and ego, but also what irks him. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Gulf and European leaders can capitalize upon this privileged access to the US president and keep him feeling central to events, then the Gaza plan has a chance of advancing. If they cannot, then no doubt it will stall. What is needed is revolving door diplomacy: a steady succession of high-level visits that feed his sense of involvement and reaffirm his role as indispensable broker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new balance of influence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, Israel was the most influential regional actor in US Middle East policy. The Gulf Arab states, whilst significant US partners, lacked the lobbying reach and policy agility to compete. Indeed, the UAE once thought that the door to influencing US policy passed through Israel – and signed up to the Abraham Accords partly on that basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the balance of influence has changed with Trump in the White House. Gulf diplomacy in Washington has strengthened considerably. Leaders such as MBS and Tamim have discovered that they can circumvent US checks and balances, as well as bureaucracy, by making a beeline for the front door. Relations are now personal, transactional and direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The ceasefire therefore owed as much to Gulf coordination as to US pressure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders and envoys from Riyadh, Doha and Abu Dhabi have embraced transactionalism with gusto, combining investment pledges, energy partnerships and defence agreements with ceremony and highly personalized engagement. In the current White House, such currency seems to buy access and influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel’s position, by contrast, has weakened. The turning point came with Israel’s strike against Hamas negotiators in Doha on 9 September. Trump, reportedly angered by Israel’s lack of coordination, treated the incident as a personal affront. His response was swift and theatrical. An executive order extended US security assurances to Qatar. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was compelled to &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/29/israeli-pm-netanyahu-apologises-to-qatar-over-doha-attack"&gt;make a televised apology to Emir Tamim&lt;/a&gt; in a call placed from the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diplomatic twist created the conditions for a broader realignment – evident during the UN General Assembly in New York later that month. &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/france" title="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and Saudi Arabia used the occasion to convene a High-Level International Conference on the Two-State Solution. On 22 September, Paris, joined by several European states, formally recognized the State of Palestine, signalling a significant diplomatic turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulf capitals seized the moment to present to Trump a coordinated ‘day after’ plan for Gaza and the West Bank, demonstrating a level of cohesion rarely seen in recent years.&amp;nbsp;Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE aligned their positions despite longstanding rivalries, while Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan lent their support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative provided Trump with a single, unified Arab proposal. Frustrated by Israeli defiance and eager for a diplomatic win, Trump used it as a template for his own peace plan. The subsequent ceasefire therefore owed as much to Gulf coordination as to US pressure. Some observers say it marked a rare instance where Arab rather than Israeli input helped shape an outcome in the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European recognitions added momentum to this shift. France’s recognition of Palestinian statehood was followed swiftly by Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta and Monaco. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the move as ‘&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/5490436-france-claps-back-rubio-gaza-criticism/"&gt;reckless&lt;/a&gt;’. Yet Trump downplayed the issue, noting for instance that he &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-he-did-not-discuss-uk-plan-recognize-palestinian-state-with-starmer-2025-07-29/"&gt;had not discussed the UK’s recognition of Palestine&lt;/a&gt; with UK Prime Minister Starmer. Europe thus secured a small diplomatic victory without provoking a backlash from the White House. That reinforced the sense amongst Arab states that the balance of influence was tilting away from &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-palestine" title="Israel and Palestine: Current affairs and analysis"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coordination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, European governments are now well placed to coordinate with &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/middle-east-and-north-africa/gulf-states" title="Gulf states"&gt;Gulf Arab states&lt;/a&gt;, Jordan, Egypt and members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), including Indonesia, Turkey and Pakistan, to keep Trump continuously engaged and maintain momentum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They should do so by underlining his relevance to the success of the 20 point plan, drawing on his frustration with Netanyahu, his ambition for a Nobel Peace Prize, and his appetite for wider normalization between Israel and regional states. Achieving this requires a steady rhythm of high-level visits, ensuring that leaders from these countries maintain a visible presence at the White House.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/11/gaza-peace-plan-needs-revolving-door-diplomacy-gulf-and-european-trump-whisperers</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 12:14:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Suppression of post-election protests in Cameroon will not solve the country's looming succession crisis</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/suppression-post-election-protests-cameroon-will-not-solve-countrys-looming-succession</link><description>&lt;span&gt;Suppression of post-election protests in Cameroon will not solve the country's looming succession crisis&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The controversial re-election of 92-year-old President Paul Biya for an eighth term has sparked protests in Cameroon. The failure to prepare a constitutional transition plan risks further destabilizing the country.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class="media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image"&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="Newspapers announce the election of Paul Biya" height="630" src="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2025-10/2025-10-31-cameroon-paul-biya-election-2243332668.jpg?itok=elICbjc9" width="1200" /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;On 27 October, more than two weeks after Cameroon’s presidential election, the country’s Constitutional Council declared victory for incumbent President Paul Biya with 53.66 per cent of the vote. The result secures an eighth term for the 92-year-old, who has been in power since 1982.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By maintaining the continuity of Cameroon’s ruling establishment under Biya, the election has deepened the legitimacy and succession crises facing the country. As security forces crack down on protests in support of the opposition, which has disputed the result of the election, the government is under popular pressure to improve its accountability and inclusivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Biya winning the election was widely viewed as a foregone conclusion, the election did not unfold seamlessly. Petitions lodged by civil society and some opposition &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/cameroons-biya-wins-re-election-official-results-show-2025-10-27/"&gt;alleged serious irregularities,&lt;/a&gt; including reported attempts at ballot box-stuffing. The opposition said &lt;a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20251027-cameroon-biya-re-elected-despite-deadly-protests-and-claims-of-fraud"&gt;‘state machinery’&lt;/a&gt; was used to manipulate the election and released footage of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1150332570617612"&gt;alleged voter fraud.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading opposition candidate, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, had refused to file a petition, but instead &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/14/cameroon-opposition-leader-declares-victory-presidential-election"&gt;declared himself the winner&lt;/a&gt; with 54.8 per cent of the vote. The Constitutional Council – composed of individuals &lt;a href="https://www.prc.cm/en/news/2671-president-paul-biya-sets-up-the-constitutional-council-and-convenes-senatorial-elections-on-25-march"&gt;appointed by Biya&lt;/a&gt; himself and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/27/nx-s1-5586685/cameroon-biya-old-africa-youth"&gt;accused by&lt;/a&gt; opposition figures of being &lt;a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/cameroon/defusing-cameroons-dangerous-electoral-standoff"&gt;deeply embedded&lt;/a&gt; in the ruling establishment – swiftly dismissed all complaints before announcing the official results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even considering the allegations of manipulation, Biya’s declared victory sits only just above the necessary majority threshold and marks a sharp decline from his previous mandates (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/22/paul-biya-cameroon-85-year-old-president-wins-re-election-landslide"&gt;71 per cent&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/22/world/africa/cameroon-election-outcome%5d"&gt;77 per cent&lt;/a&gt; in 2011). This reflects a substantial shift in public sentiment and political alliances, suggesting the ruling establishment underestimated the popular desire for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immediate instability and militarized response&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widespread support for Tchiroma, despite him having served in various ministerial roles under Biya from 1992 until earlier this year, demonstrates the magnitude of demand for leadership change. While Biya has played an important role balancing between different political factions, he has made few public appearances recently and his decision to stand for another seven-year-term was contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most controversially, Biya was declared &lt;a href="https://actucameroun.com/2025/10/27/presidentielle-2025-voici-les-resultats-definitifs-par-region/"&gt;overwhelmingly victorious&lt;/a&gt; in Cameroon’s restive Anglophone regions, where separatists have been fighting the government for a decade. According to the official results, Biya received 86.31 per cent of the vote in the North West region and 68.79 per cent in the South West. (He also won with 45.93 per cent in the Far North region, which is facing an Islamist insurgency.) Given Biya’s &lt;a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/cameroon/defusing-cameroons-dangerous-electoral-standoff"&gt;lack of popularity&lt;/a&gt; and the regime’s failure to resolve long-running crises in these regions, where separatists have imposed lockdowns to restrict movement during the elections, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/cameroons-biya-wins-re-election-official-results-show-2025-10-27/"&gt;many doubt&lt;/a&gt; the veracity of these results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Escalating militarization risks linking urban political dissent to long-standing armed conflicts in Cameroon’s peripheral regions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official announcement sparked sizeable protests in major urban areas, as well as among the Cameroonian diaspora. Tchiroma’s ability to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/cameroon-opposition-leader-rejects-biya-win-vows-resistance-2025-10-29/"&gt;sustain this popular mobilization&lt;/a&gt; will determine what happens next. It is likely to be obstructed by Cameroon’s heavily militarized response to dissent. Supporters of the main opposition challenger in 2018, Maurice Kamto, were arrested and imprisoned following the post-election crisis that year. Statements by the Minister of Territorial Administration saying that Tchiroma will be &lt;a href="https://mimimefoinfos.com/atanga-nji-counters-tchiromas-victory-claim/?fbclid=IwY2xjawNt1ZFleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFZS2JuOU5OV05SWFpzZkp3AR6YgVJ1pvdzZXZ4C8ZlzjFaaeVABJq9Pohy951GeHsV55xC7aPvviGnN-OcGA_aem_hmkT6d3D3fOaFqm09X4TKw"&gt;‘dealt with rigorously and firmly’&lt;/a&gt; point to a potential similar escalation of repression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The military has been preparing to support the police and gendarmerie in containing the protests in cities, including by redeploying soldiers from the Far North. At least four civilians were &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly4x9n0yvno"&gt;reportedly killed&lt;/a&gt; by security forces during demonstrations on 26 October. Tchiroma alleged that another two peaceful protestors &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cx2k4w58w91t"&gt;were shot&lt;/a&gt; on 27 October outside his residence in the city of Garoua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more mass demonstrations planned, escalating militarization risks linking urban political dissent to long-standing armed conflicts in Cameroon’s peripheral regions. This would add further pressure on a security system that has already been challenged for a decade by Islamist militant groups in the Far North, and Anglophone separatism in the South West and North West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration might be tempted to unilaterally postpone the legislative election, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/cameroons-president-wins-backing-delay-legislative-local-polls-2024-07-09/"&gt;already delayed&lt;/a&gt; until 2026, in order to regain its footing. But this move would almost certainly trigger renewed public unrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The looming succession crisis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the ruling establishment’s ability to execute its electoral strategy entrenches its greatest structural weakness. Biya’s victory points directly to the absence of a legitimate political mechanism for leadership transition within the current system and intensifies the risk of a chaotic and violent succession process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/suppression-post-election-protests-cameroon-will-not-solve-countrys-looming-succession</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 15:16:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What can COP30 achieve, following US withdrawal and underwhelming climate plans?</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/what-can-cop30-achieve-following-us-withdrawal-and-underwhelming-climate-plans</link><description>&lt;span&gt;What can COP30 achieve, following US withdrawal and underwhelming climate plans?  &lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;November’s UN climate summit in Brazil won’t put the world on track for 1.5 °C. But it can demonstrate sustained commitment to tackling climate change and support the implementation of pledges made at previous COPs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It is easy to feel uninspired about the UN’s upcoming climate change conference, COP30, taking place 10&lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;21 November in Belém, Brazil.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key ask for governments ahead of the conference is to submit new national climate plans (Nationally Determined Contributions, NDCs) covering the period up to 2035. Countries had agreed this should be done 9 to 12 months before the COP, but as of 30 September 2025 only 64 countries – covering around 30 per cent of global emissions in 2019 &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; had submitted new NDCs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2025_08.pdf"&gt;stocktaking report released by the UN&lt;/a&gt; on 28 October states that a ‘major acceleration is still needed in terms of delivering faster and deeper emission reductions’, but cautions against drawing global-level conclusions based on the small number of NDCs analysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/news/the-direction-of-travel-improving-every-year-but-we-need-to-urgently-pick-up-the-pace-un-climate"&gt;Additional calculations&lt;/a&gt; by the UN, which take into account NDCs pledged but not yet formally submitted, project global emissions will fall by around 10 per cent by 2035. This is woefully inadequate: to limit warming to 1.5 °C, emissions would need to fall by around 60 per cent by that year, compared to the level in 2019. Indeed, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/28/change-course-now-humanity-has-missed-15c-climate-target-says-un-head"&gt;the UN Secretary-General says&lt;/a&gt; it is now inevitable the 1.5 °C threshold will be breached, at least temporarily, with devastating consequences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="h5 teaser__title"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is COP30 and why does it matter for the climate?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the US &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; the world’s second largest emitter &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement (again) does not help. At home, the administration of President Donald Trump is waging war on renewable energy, while promoting what the president calls ‘&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-clean-coal-thing/story?id=119920490"&gt;beautiful, clean coal&lt;/a&gt;’. As a result of these policies, the International Energy Agency has &lt;a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/76ad6eac-2aa6-4c55-9a55-b8dc0dba9f9e/Renewables2025.pdf"&gt;cut its 2030 forecast&lt;/a&gt; for growth in US renewable power capacity by half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, extensive cuts to overseas development assistance (ODA) by the US – and by many other rich countries &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; could have a significant impact on the provision of climate funding. Before the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) dismantled USAID, the US accounted for nearly &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-nearly-a-tenth-of-global-climate-finance-threatened-by-trump-aid-cuts/#:%7E:text=Trump%20has%20halted%20US%20foreign,according%20to%20Carbon%20Brief%20analysis."&gt;10 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of global climate finance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US is also increasingly deploying its economic might to prevent or delay climate action overseas. In mid-October, the members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the adoption of their landmark ‘Net-Zero Framework’ by one year following intense pressure from the US, Saudi Arabia and other like-minded states. As part of its ‘&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/22/trump-administration-pushes-europe-to-change-corporate-climate-law-00618140"&gt;all hands on deck&lt;/a&gt;’ lobbying campaign, the US had &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/10/taking-action-to-defend-america-from-the-uns-first-global-carbon-tax-the-international-maritime-organizations-imo-net-zero-framework-nzf"&gt;openly threatened economic penalties&lt;/a&gt; against countries backing the IMO plan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop of inadequate NDCs, ODA cuts and difficult geopolitics, an obvious question is: what can COP30 realistically achieve?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COP30 as a galvanizing force&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it is important to note the global energy transition is continuing despite Trump administration policy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that investment in the electricity sector will reach &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2025"&gt;$1.5 trillion in 2025&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;around 50 per cent higher than the amount spent on fossil fuels. In the first half of 2025, &lt;a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/global-electricity-mid-year-insights-2025/"&gt;renewables surpassed coal&lt;/a&gt; as the leading source of electricity globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is the clear driver of the renewable energy boom, and renewable energy generation is actually &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5af9367e-821c-4907-9f27-1371a928371e"&gt;growing faster in some of the world’s emerging economies&lt;/a&gt; than in some of the richest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="media__content"&gt;

          &lt;use xlink:href="#icon-open-quote" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;COP30 is not intended to broker a new international agreement. It’s about implementing commitments already made.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on this momentum, COP30 needs to demonstrate there are governments, businesses, and institutions that still want to take action – and which are taking action &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; to address climate change. As such, the conference can provide a rallying force in a difficult geopolitical context. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this to happen, it is important world leaders show up and deliver ambitious statements at the Leaders’ Summit taking place just before COP30 formally gets underway. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s decision to go to Belém is a promising step.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil is working hard ahead of the conference to prepare declarations, for instance on carbon markets, methane, and forest fires. Such declarations, if key countries are included, could be important demonstrations of commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Less negotiations, more implementation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, COP30 is not intended to broker a new international agreement. It’s about implementing commitments already made, including through the Paris Agreement and the outcome of the ‘Global Stocktake’ (GST) from 2023. This does not necessarily require consensus among the governments present.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian COP30 team is seeking to provide structure and direction to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCop8OW3l6k"&gt;the ‘Action Agenda’&lt;/a&gt;, a process bringing together cities, regions, businesses, investors, civil society and governments to implement the Paris Agreement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of existing climate-related initiatives and coalitions have been grouped into clusters aligned with the themes of the GST to facilitate coordination and monitoring. Joint ‘implementation acceleration plans’ are also being developed within these groupings, which could speed up delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil hopes to create a model for the Action Agenda that can persist over time - enhancing coordination, strengthening accountability, and identifying bottlenecks and key next steps. If successful, these efforts would constitute important progress in terms of transitioning the COPs from focusing on negotiations to supporting implementation. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/what-can-cop30-achieve-following-us-withdrawal-and-underwhelming-climate-plans</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 11:05:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Members' Question Time: Is the US pushing regime change in Venezuela?

  &lt;p&gt;The latest escalation in U.S. pressure on Venezuela has reignited debate over Washington’s long-term objectives in Latin America. With new sanctions, sharper rhetoric, and open support for opposition figures, questions are once again being raised about whether the United States is pursuing a strategy of regime change in Venezuela— and if so, why now. At the same time, the White House has inserted itself in Argentine politics before the 26 October mid-term congressional elections and imposed sanctions on Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro and threatened to end US security and financial assistance and impose tariffs on the country’s export to the United States. &amp;nbsp;The moves have drawn scrutiny both regionally and in global policy circles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Member’s Question Time will examine the motivations behind recent U.S. actions, the internal dynamics driving Venezuela’s crisis, the potential scenarios for US military action and the broader stakes for the Latin America region. &amp;nbsp;Dr Sabatini will explore what Washington’s strategy reveals about its approach to the Western Hemisphere, how other governments in the hemisphere are reacting and implications for relations with China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America, as he examines the latest in developments between US-Venezuelan relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:rsvp@chathamhouse.org"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submit your questions to the experts&amp;nbsp;in advance of the event&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Victory for President Samia Suluhu Hassan and her CCM party is assured after a crackdown on the opposition. But this result could affect Tanzania’s longer-term ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class="media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image"&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="A supporter of Tanzania's ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party holds a banner bearing the portrait of President Samia Suluhu Hassan." height="630" src="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2025-10/2025-10-23-tanzania-election-2231787942.jpg?itok=s0DA1x7w" width="1200" /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Tanzania’s general election on 29 October is a historic moment in one respect. President Samia Suluhu Hassan – who came to power after the &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/03/tanzania-gets-second-chance-confront-magufuli-legacy" title="Tanzania gets second chance to confront Magufuli legacy"&gt;sudden death&lt;/a&gt; of her predecessor John Magufuli in 2021 – will be on the ballot for the first time. Her widely anticipated victory would be only the third time a woman has been popularly elected as president of an African country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond this, the polls are more of a historical relic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="media__content"&gt;
        &lt;svg class="icon icon--open-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
          &lt;use xlink:href="#icon-open-quote" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;President Samia’s approach to governance has been varied – but has taken an increasingly repressive turn over the last two years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not since before the advent of multi-party democracy in Tanzania has the ruling CCM party, in power since independence, faced so little competitive opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition leader Tundu Lissu has been imprisoned since April on treason charges, with his CHADEMA party banned from the election. Another prominent contender and ruling party defector, Luhaga Mpina, is barred from running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voter registration in 1990 – the final poll under the one-party system – stood at 7.3 million, while today the electoral commission reports &lt;a href="https://thechanzo.com/2025/08/04/inec-tanzania-responds-to-concerns-over-voter-register-numbers/"&gt;over 37 million people&lt;/a&gt; are eligible to vote. Despite the size of the electorate increasing fivefold, Tanzanians are left with a similar lack of choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Democracy in decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Samia’s approach to governance has been varied – but has taken an increasingly repressive turn over the last two years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she first came to power in 2021, she oversaw the imprisonment of then-CHADEMA leader Freeman Mbowe. But by early 2023 there were &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/07/tanzania-sees-only-glimpses-change-new-president" title="Tanzania sees only glimpses of change by new president"&gt;partial signs of change&lt;/a&gt; such as the lifting of a ban on political rallies and beginning of dialogue with opposition. However, ensuing electoral reforms were only cosmetic – as evidenced by CCM sweeping over 98 per cent of seats in &lt;a href="https://thechanzo.com/2024/11/29/tanzanias-ccm-wins-big-in-local-govt-elections-that-opposition-parties-dismissed-as-a-sham/"&gt;2024’s local elections&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tanzania civic election results 2009–24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-center embedded-entity embed"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threats to civic space have not only impacted Tanzania’s political elite. Recent reports by &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/06/tanzania-un-experts-alarmed-pattern-enforced-disappearance-and-torture"&gt;UN experts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/09/29/tanzania-deepening-repression-threatens-elections"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; – strongly &lt;a href="https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/national/tanzania-dismisses-human-rights-abuse-allegations-at-un-forum-5086710"&gt;refuted&lt;/a&gt; by the Tanzanian government – highlight a pattern of abductions and attacks on activists, journalists and religious leaders. As aid budgets shrink and global priorities shift, economic pragmatism and perceived ‘political stability’ have taken precedence, leaving traditional development partners with little leverage or incentive to speak out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparisons between Samia and her predecessor, or commentary attributing her actions to the influence of his former party loyalists, are not always accurate or analytically useful. Many have highlighted Samia’s early nomination as the CCM’s presidential candidate in January this year as an unprecedented break with internal party democracy. But this lack of internal competition is not new. Ahead of the 2020 election, Magufuli’s only potential rival was &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-28/tanzania-s-ruling-party-expels-ex-foreign-minister-ahead-of-vote"&gt;expelled from the party&lt;/a&gt; after indicating a possible challenge. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor is it clear that any coherent ‘Magufuli faction’ is to blame for governance issues. Many of the former president’s key allies were quickly sidelined – such as former CCM secretary general Bashiru Ally or the late speaker of parliament Job Ndugai – or have been shuffled in and out of cabinet. Others have become government critics, including former CCM official Humphrey Polepole who was &lt;a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/394794/exclusive-abducted-tanzanian-former-ambassador-humphrey-polepole-is-dead-sources/"&gt;reportedly violently abducted&lt;/a&gt; on 6 October after making a series of public statements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tanzania presidential election results 2000–20&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-center embedded-entity embed"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four years in power, President Samia must be judged on her actions and not those of her predecessor. A focus on past comparison risks obscuring the consequences for the future, as closing national political space raises the stakes for potential political challengers within the CCM.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This not only limits transparency and public choice but also increases policy uncertainty due to the repeated reshuffling of officials along factional lines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tanzania’s economic potential deserves better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Samia’s campaign focuses heavily on her economic impact and achievements. Cushioned by its status as a leading gold exporter, Tanzania’s growth has been resilient despite global shocks; inflation has remained stable, and the country has so far avoided the high risk of external debt distress encountered by some of its neighbours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Megaprojects inherited from the previous administration, such as a hydropower dam and standard gauge railway, have made progress while new projects are also in development. These include a $500 million investment in the &lt;a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/news/perseus-mining-nyanzaga-gold/"&gt;Nyanzaga gold mine&lt;/a&gt;, a $1.2 billion &lt;a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/pilot-uranium-processing-plant-launched-in-tanzania"&gt;uranium project&lt;/a&gt; with a Russian firm, and a $1.4 billion deal with &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/asia-pacific/china" title="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; to refurbish the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/china-signs-deal-with-zambia-tanzania-14-billion-railway-upgrade-2025-09-29/"&gt;TAZARA railway&lt;/a&gt; connecting Tanzania and Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These deals highlight Tanzania’s clear strategic potential: it has abundant natural resources; is a gateway to major inland markets; and is unwilling to be pigeonholed amid growing geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a lack of consistency threatens wider transformation, particularly in the energy sector. Progress on a $40 billion investment to develop Tanzania’s offshore gas reserves has stalled repeatedly since a deal was signed in June 2022, while the government is facing a $1.2 billion &lt;a href="https://orcaenergygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Press-Release-Arbitration.pdf"&gt;arbitration claim&lt;/a&gt; over its decision to terminate a key gas-to-power project after 20 years – influenced by an error-strewn &lt;a href="https://www.nao.go.tz/uploads/PUBLIC_AUTHORITIES__OTHER_BODIES_FOR_THE_FINANCIAL_YEAR_2018-2019.pdf"&gt;auditor general’s report&lt;/a&gt; from 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanzania’s newly launched development blueprint Vision2050 sets out an ambition for the country to become an upper-middle-income economy by 2050, alongside a new &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/04/reviving-tanzanias-regional-leadership-and-global-engagement" title="Reviving Tanzania’s regional leadership and global engagement "&gt;foreign policy strategy&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p&gt;Recent high-profile cyberattacks on British businesses underscore the need to elevate cybersecurity on the political agenda and prepare for rapidly escalating threats from both hostile states and criminal actors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;As countries gather in Hanoi to sign the first-ever UN binding &lt;a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/convention/home.html"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; on cybercrime, the UK’s National Cyber  Security  Centre (NCSC) has issued a sobering assessment of the cyberthreats facing the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCSC’s &lt;a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/ncsc-annual-review-2025.pdf"&gt;annual review,&lt;/a&gt; which comes after recent &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy9pdld4y81o"&gt;high-profile cyberattacks&lt;/a&gt; on British businesses, warned that the number of cyber incidents that pose a risk on a national level has risen dramatically. The agency classified nearly half of all the cyber incidents it handled in the past year as nationally significant – a record high.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a nation that prides itself on digital innovation, this should be a wake-up call. The UK needs to take decisive action to strengthen resilience, support businesses and secure critical infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without these steps, the UK is at risk of a cascading cyber crisis scenario – where coordinated or interconnected attacks could spread rapidly across sectors, disrupting essential services, supply chains and the economy. The consequences would extend far beyond the digital realm, touching every part of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rapidly escalating threats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCSC’s latest review leaves little room for complacency. The UK faces an intensifying mix of threats from state and criminal actors, with China, Russia, Iran and North Korea identified as persistent and highly capable adversaries. Hostile state actors increasingly target critical national infrastructure, supply chains and key economic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The NCSC’s stark assessment should serve as a wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, threats are being reshaped by the rapid evolution of ransomware and the growing use of AI-enabled tools for reconnaissance and exploitation. In addition, the proliferation of commercial cyber intrusion tools has lowered the barrier to entry for sophisticated attacks. These tools include spyware and remote access software that was developed for government or corporate use but is increasingly sold on the open market. Together, these trends are expanding the pool of capable actors and accelerating the speed and scale at which attacks can occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent attacks on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, and the Co-op Group illustrate that the threat is not confined to foreign states or external perpetrators. Criminal actors, including from &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gqepe5355o"&gt;within the UK,&lt;/a&gt; were allegedly behind these attacks. The attacks disrupted production lines, emptied supermarket shelves and exposed how deeply the economy depends on digital systems that remain acutely vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The gap between policy and practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK’s &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-cyber-strategy-2022"&gt;national cyber strategy,&lt;/a&gt; released in late 2021 and set for a refresh this year, adopted a ‘whole-of-society’ approach, where government, business and citizens all play a role in building resilience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a good principle, but implementation has not kept pace with the threat. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill"&gt;Cyber Security and Resilience Bill&lt;/a&gt; announced in the King’s speech in July 2024 is meant to strengthen baseline security standards across industries. However, it has been repeatedly delayed and has not yet been introduced to parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior ministers, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68ecf8c6e7b6794c076bbd7f/HMG_cyber_letter_to_FTSE_350_-_for_sharing.pdf"&gt;wrote last week&lt;/a&gt; to FTSE 350 executives urging them to take concrete measures to improve their cyber resilience. While such guidance is important, translating awareness into concrete action will require stronger and timely regulation, incentives and enforcement mechanisms. Otherwise, the risk is that many companies will continue to treat cybersecurity as a cost burden, rather than a matter of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The time for action is now – before a crisis forces the government’s hand under far less favourable circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences are plain to see. The attacks on Co-op and M&amp;amp;S forced temporary store closures and distribution chaos. JLR halted production for &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy9pdld4y81o"&gt;five weeks.&lt;/a&gt; These are not isolated events – they reveal how one cyber incident can ripple across supply chains and disrupt logistics, manufacturing and consumer confidence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And whilst large corporations may have resources to recover, they are not immune. JLR, for example, required a government-backed &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/33d91816-514f-4da1-b6dd-abedbc21df61"&gt;loan package&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize operations after its recent cyber incident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by contrast, generally have fewer financial or technical buffers to protect themselves adequately. They are hit frequently by cyberattacks, often with devastating impact. This creates a systemic weak point: if SMEs collapse, so may the larger networks they feed into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blurring lines, growing risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes today’s threats so dangerous is the blurring of lines between state and criminal actors. &lt;a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/article/russia-jaguar-land-rover-cyber-attack-5HjdFG9_2/"&gt;Ongoing investigations&lt;/a&gt; are examining possible Russian links to the JLR attack; if confirmed, it would underscore how tightly intertwined domestic and foreign cyberthreats have become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hybrid ecosystem means the UK could easily face simultaneous attacks of different kinds – some strategic, some criminal, but all compounding in effect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider what a cascading cyber crisis might look like in practice. State-linked groups and criminal operations could strike multiple sectors simultaneously: energy, finance, healthcare, and transport. Essential services would be crippled, economic activity would grind to a halt, and national security would be directly threatened.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is no longer a theoretical exercise. The infrastructure exists, the capabilities are available, and the incentives are clear – whether financial, political, or strategic. The UK’s cyber ecosystem contains numerous weak links that could be exploited to trigger such a cascade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Global action is vital, but not enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN Convention against Cybercrime, which will be signed in Vietnam this weekend, is a milestone in international cooperation against cybercrime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It aims to strengthen law-enforcement collaboration, streamline digital evidence sharing and combat transnational crimes such as ransomware and online child sexual exploitation. These are worthy goals. The UK should champion them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/uk-must-prioritize-cybersecurity-or-be-left-dangerously-exposed</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 09:24:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Top 5 books: IA goes nuclear</title><link>https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-5-books-ia-goes-nuclear-82c1467b9d36?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</link><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g2qFnA7t29K-y2TMYHjKbQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whether you like the autumn or not, we can all agree that having cooler weather is better than having no seasons (and no planet) at all. This is the likely scenario in the aftermath of a worldwide nuclear war or even a series of nuclear accidents, brought about by climate-induced changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book Reviews Editor Mariana Vieira has selected a handful of the newest books offering nuanced explorations of nuclear-related issues in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;International Relations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. As some of these books warn and as others prove to be the case, the dangers of nuclear weapons, nuclear energy and nuclear testing should not be disregarded. As others detail, approaches to nuclear proliferation are never homogeneous and resistance to nuclear-armed states is not simply a mirage. From soon-to-be Hollywood movies to anti-nuclear manifestos, these five books do much to pluralize the discussion of all things nuclear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1) Nuclear war&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/0*WXP8sSS7OAgL71lx.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Annie Jacobsen. Published in London by Torva.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Nuclear war&lt;/em&gt;, Pulitzer prize winner Annie Jacobsen describes a hypothetical scenario based on factual information. Drawing from interviews with highly relevant stakeholders, from individuals tasked with developing nuclear strategy to those dealing with the aftermath of a nuclear attack, Jacobsen outlines the terrifying outcome, retaliation and potentially planet-devastating war that would be unleashed if North Korea launched a surprise nuclear attack on the United States. In a masterful storytelling style, the book drives home the timely point that, in ‘a world with more than enough nuclear warheads to kill the planet several times over’, it will not matter who started the war because there will be no winners.

Published in Bielefeld, Germany by transcript publishing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Jacobsen’s book has left you slowly veering towards nihilism, Sascha Hach’s reinterpretation of the Humanitarian Initiative (HI) and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) as collective acts of resistance will breathe hope back into your life. The author combines sociological, critical and postcolonial approaches in a hybrid framework that spotlights how non-nuclear weapon states, particularly in the global South, have sought to overcome their marginalization in global nuclear governance and to subvert proliferation. The book’s offerings are bountiful: mapping several actors and alliances beyond states; offering a clear conceptual framework and in-depth theoretical engagement without sacrificing accessibility; and empirically investigating the resistance tactics employed in the processes of the HI and TPNW. Hach delivers a powerful reminder that coordinated acts of rebellion can rely on lawful means, while remaining careful not to overstate their limited disruptive potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf160"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3) The ocean on fire&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/0*FycCOjYHPaxMTWnL.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Anaïs Maurer. Published in Durham, NC by Duke University Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of marginalization in the nuclear sphere, &lt;em&gt;The ocean on fire&lt;/em&gt; brings the discussion from the material to the epistemological realm, while adding a much-needed human dimension to the conversation. As Anaïs Maurer warns and our reviewer puts it: ‘The challenges for which overindustrialized countries seek to prepare are already the lived reality of Pacific peoples.’ The author painstakingly demonstrates how environmental degradation and the impacts of nuclear testing have long been felt in Oceania, and how its Pacific communities have been largely sidelined as the Pacific has been conceived as existing ‘outside of history’. In bringing back the contributions of Pacific epistemologies, Maurer paves the way for alternative understandings of how we relate to the environment in light of nuclear and climate related crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf161"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4) Nuclear is not the solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/0*BXDlqlb-9JNncc8U.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by M. V. Ramana. Published in London by Verso.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If no good can come from nuclear weapons, is atomic power worth pursuing? In the context of climate change, M. V. Ramana’s rigorous and well-researched book argues that &lt;em&gt;Nuclear is not the solution&lt;/em&gt;. Methodologically, the author discredits and disproves existing arguments in favour of investing in or scaling up the use of nuclear energy. The book extensively details the key issues with pursuing nuclear energy as a power source, from its temporal and financial costs to the negative impact of uranium mining, and to the liability of power plants and reactors in the contexts of armed conflict and natural disasters. This telling myth-busting exercise not only sheds light on the dangers and costs of nuclear energy, but it also exposes the flawed rationales underpinning the false promise of atomic power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf081"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5) The global third nuclear age&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/0*_TGwYA5mVO-Ank9N.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written by Andrew Futter, Ludovica Castelli, Cameron Hunter, Olamide Samuel, Francesca Silvestri and Benjamin Zala. Published in Abingdon and New York by Routledge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, but certainly not least, &lt;em&gt;The global third nuclear age&lt;/em&gt; takes the interrogation of ‘global’ as its starting-point to displace ‘western nuclear ethnocentrism’. In this open-access book, the authors criticize the existing focus within contemporary nuclear politics that limits analysis to the nine nuclear-armed states and overlooks regional sensitivities. In this way, it shares Hach’s impetus to pluralize the study of global nuclear governance. The main contribution is a nuanced categorization of 20 states according to how the elites in each country shape and respond to three different factors: technological change, shifts in global power balances and global nuclear norms. Moreover, the analysis of responses to shifting trends will benefit policy-makers and academics alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full review &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaf128"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mariana Vieira is the Book Reviews Editor of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia"&gt;International Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find the latest book reviews section in our September 2025 issue &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ia/issue/101/5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more reading suggestions, check out the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/tagged/ia-bookshelf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IA Bookshelf series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are interested in reviewing a book for the journal, register your interest in our book review application form &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6ZOiHKZ2WYj8UEaaXy9-gVuv_0ONmB2x2pv1x9-VcSWwCdg/viewform"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/IAJournal_CH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter/X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-affairs-journal/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iajournal.bsky.social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluesky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; where we post call outs for specific books and experts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All views expressed are individual not institutional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=82c1467b9d36" width="1" /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-5-books-ia-goes-nuclear-82c1467b9d36"&gt;Top 5 books: IA goes nuclear&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog"&gt;International Affairs Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://medium.com/international-affairs-blog/top-5-books-ia-goes-nuclear-82c1467b9d36?source=rss----914f4a3521ea---4</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 14:11:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The European Political Community can be more than an ‘unidentified political object’</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/european-political-community-can-be-more-unidentified-political-object</link><description>&lt;span&gt;The European Political Community can be more than an ‘unidentified political object’&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The EPC is helping to forge an awareness of shared European strategic interests. It should now set itself the clear task of redesigning Europe’s strategic security architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The European Political Community (EPC) held its seventh meeting in Copenhagen on 2 October.&amp;nbsp;There was no guarantee that the EPC, a 2022 initiative of French President Emmanuel Macron, would ever last this long. It was met with much scepticism at its creation, from candidate countries to the European Union, from Germany and even from France itself. But the continuing high attendance of national leaders indicates that the idea certainly has merit. Still, questions remain about its purpose. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A one-of-a-kind standing conference&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders’ continued attendance is due in part to the continuing severe security outlook for Europe. The EPC was proposed immediately after Russia’s full-scale invasion of &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-departments-and-programmes/russia-and-eurasia-programme/russias-war-ukraine" title="Russia’s war on Ukraine "&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. The war raised deeper questions about Europe’s security architecture, made even more acute since President Donald Trump’s return to power.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Times of trouble require new opportunities for privileged dialogue. The EPC has provided a greater scope for reflection, grasping the whole continent from Iceland and Greenland to &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/united-kingdom" title="United Kingdom"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; and Turkey, regardless of EU membership, reflecting the shared links and interests inherent in a geography that neither globalization nor the digital age have overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The EPC…allows for wide-ranging discussions between leaders from ‘small’ and ‘big’ countries. A lack of expectation of declarations or treaties sometimes serves as a strength.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPC is also boosted by the simplicity of its informal format. It only took a launching summit in Prague to officially create it. It has no true legal basis (there is no founding treaty). It has no institutional or budgetary resources. Membership requires no preparation. Its summits do not adopt any conclusions, favouring instead direct exchange between peers. This informality distinguishes the EPC from well-established organizations such as the Council of Europe or the OSCE, avoiding their cumbersome protocols and procedures &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; sometimes compared to a kind of European political Davos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That informality means the EPC is not equipped to deliver concrete projects. However, it has a proven ability to communicate European messages of political solidarity: it sent a clear signal of support for Ukraine at its launch in Prague. At its Budapest summit, it hosted continent-wide consultation in the aftermath of Trump’s election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Blenheim summit provided a showcase for post-Brexit rapprochement: Indeed, for the UK, the EPC has provided an important opportunity to return to the European stage independently of Starmer’s ‘reset’ with &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/topics/european-union-eu" title="European Union (EU)"&gt;the EU&lt;/a&gt;. The UK’s enthusiasm is cross-party &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; Tory governments had pushed for a summit to be held in the UK.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a message of cooperation to tackle &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/topics/refugees-and-migration" title="Refugees and migration"&gt;migration&lt;/a&gt; has been repeated throughout various summits (Granada, Blenheim, Copenhagen). And the EPC has proved a useful forum to discuss the defence of Ukraine and security more generally across cyberattacks, energy, critical infrastructure, migration, drug trafficking, disinformation and other new forms of hybrid pressure on so-called democratic security. Specific cooperation initiatives have also been promoted, such as the one against drug trafficking taken by Italy and &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/france" title="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPC also hosts smaller-scale meetings on thorny regional tensions such as those between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Turkey and Cyprus, and Serbia and Kosovo. No decisive breakthrough can be attributed solely to the EPC, but it provides a neutral and agile channel for mediation at the highest level. It also allows for wide-ranging discussions between leaders from ‘small’ and ‘big’ countries. A lack of expectation of declarations or treaties sometimes serves as a strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the key to assessing the EPC may be the degree of ‘strategic intimacy’, to use Macron’s expression, that its summits enable. The EPC is fundamentally an interpersonal organization, a ‘leaders only’ club that relies on ‘fireside chats’ to promote a culture of dialogue and build trust. In that respect the EPC builds on the approach of the original European Council and G5 (now &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/topics/g7-and-g20" title="G7 and G20"&gt;G7&lt;/a&gt;), but on an unprecedented scale. The EPC can therefore also be judged by the personal relationships between European leaders that it nurtures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What future for the EPC?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The successful holding of summits is not enough to definitively prove the EPC adds any value, nor to guarantee its sustainability. Moreover, its continuation is not an end in itself. Diplomatic formats are meant to constantly adapt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the EPC format holds great potential in the context of rapid geopolitical change. With the Russian threat becoming more acute and transatlantic solidarity no longer a given, the European Political Community, by its very name, could help chart a distinct course.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after three years, the EPC is entering a second phase. Its repeated summits are gradually forging an awareness of belonging to a community of shared European strategic interests imposed by geography.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The EPC…could prove to be a useful format of last resort should the EU or other European multilateral institutions become blocked or neglected by a rising far right.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a French point of view, the EPC can contribute to the project of affirming Europe as a world power, enabling engagement in truly continental strategic reflection. But to realize that potential, more assertive support from &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/germany" title="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and Turkey will be required. So far Berlin has participated reluctantly, Ankara unevenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPC has also yet to find the right balance with other established European organizations. That is important, as it could prove to be a useful format of last resort should the EU or other European multilateral institutions become blocked or neglected by a rising far right. And the EPC must find the right relationship with NATO, at a time when the alliance is set to become more Europeanized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPC’s primary purpose should be the strategic task of designing Europe’s security architecture for the period after the War in Ukraine. European experts &lt;a href="https://big-europe.eu/publications/big006-continental-diplomacy-for-a-new-era-the-european-political-community-from-prague-to-copenhagen"&gt;Antoine Michon and Luuk van Middelaar suggest&lt;/a&gt; its role should be compared to that played by the 1973 Helsinki Conference during the Cold War, which later led to the creation of OSCE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/european-political-community-can-be-more-unidentified-political-object</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 10:10:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia’s long war in Ukraine: what would persuade Moscow to end it?</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/events/all/research-event/russias-long-war-ukraine-what-would-persuade-moscow-end-it</link><description>&lt;span&gt;Russia’s long war in Ukraine: what would persuade Moscow to end it?&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Analysing potential end-state scenarios for the war on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this discussion, the panellists will examine potential end-state scenarios for the war, its dynamics of escalation, and the unsettling echoes of 1914 and 1939. They will also explore how the war is transforming Russia itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 shattered the post-Cold War security architecture and disrupted the rules-based international order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Putin has stated that the war is not merely a territorial conflict but a contest over much broader and fundamental issues; it is about ‘the principles on which the new world order will be based.’ What are the issues that Russia is trying to settle, and what kind of outcome will satisfy its ambitions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key questions to be discussed during this event include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do historical parallels with the 20th century &amp;nbsp;suggest we are witnessing the prelude to another world war?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are we seeing the birth of a new kind of conflict, one shaped by new technology as well as ideology?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is the war reshaping Russia internally?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How should Europe and NATO prepare to deal with the Russia that emerges from this war?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While Ukraine is fighting for its national survival, is this war equally existential for Putin’s regime?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By registering for this event, attendees agree to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/events/code-conduct" title="Code of conduct"&gt;&lt;em&gt;code of conduct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, ensuring a respectful, inclusive, and welcoming space for diverse perspectives and debate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/events/all/research-event/russias-long-war-ukraine-what-would-persuade-moscow-end-it</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 09:52:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Can the UK afford to fight a war?</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/events/all/open-event/can-uk-afford-fight-war</link><description>&lt;span&gt;Can the UK afford to fight a war?&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Assessing the post-budget outlook for Britain’s defence and security commitments&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the UK Budget, this discussion examines what the government’s fiscal choices reveal about Britain’s capacity to meet its defence and security ambitions. With global threats intensifying—from Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine to rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific—the UK faces growing pressure to reconcile its strategic commitments with economic realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panellists will assess how the Budget’s spending priorities affect the government’s ability to sustain its NATO obligations, modernize the armed forces, and respond to emerging security challenges. The conversation will also explore the political and economic trade-offs between fiscal restraint and defence preparedness, and what they mean for Britain’s credibility as a military and diplomatic power in an era of renewed great-power competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By registering for this event, attendees agree to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/events/code-conduct" title="Code of conduct"&gt;&lt;em&gt;our code of conduct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, ensuring a respectful, inclusive, and welcoming space for diverse perspectives and debate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chathamhouse.org/events/all/open-event/can-uk-afford-fight-war</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 14:12:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>China’s new restrictions on rare earth exports send a stark warning to the West</title><link>https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/chinas-new-restrictions-rare-earth-exports-send-stark-warning-west</link><description>&lt;span&gt;China’s new restrictions on rare earth exports send a stark warning to the West&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;China’s new rare earth export controls should galvanize the West to build resilience against China’s growing dominance in global manufacturing and its control over crucial supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

Crucially, any foreign firm that wants to supply rare earths produced in China or processed with Chinese technologies outside China will also need to get a license, according to &lt;a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202510/1345192.shtml"&gt;China’s Ministry of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These restrictions send a particularly powerful signal because Chinese companies control more than &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3328358/china-says-unnamed-foreign-groups-are-using-its-rare-earth-exports-military-purposes"&gt;90 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of the world’s processing capacity for rare earths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new rules could also give President Xi Jinping greater leverage as he prepares to meet US President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month to discuss bilateral trade frictions. The rare earths that Beijing is increasing its control over are critical to a range of technologies from electric vehicles to wind turbines and defence systems. The new restrictions on rare earths come amid a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-xi-meet-four-weeks-us-president-says-2025-10-01/"&gt;freeze by China on buying US soybeans&lt;/a&gt; from the autumn harvest – another instance of Beijing building leverage with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move by Beijing refocuses attention on how China uses its influence as the world’s biggest trading nation and its dominance of manufacturing supply chains to project its power in international affairs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s willingness to use its trade heft to advance geopolitical goals should make policymakers in the West wake up to the burgeoning power of China’s manufacturing supply chain and its control over certain so-called ‘chokepoint’ technologies – which it can limit access to at will.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;China’s growing dominance of global manufacturing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/unido-publications/2024-11/The Future of Industrialization - Building Future-ready Industries to Turn Challenges into Sustainable Solutions.pdf"&gt;report by UNIDO&lt;/a&gt; (The United Nations Industrial Development Organization) projects that by 2030, China will account for 45 per cent of global manufacturing value added, compared to 11 per cent for the United States, 5 per cent for Japan, 3 per cent for Germany and even less for the &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/europe/united-kingdom" title="United Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report did not give a current value for China’s share of global manufacturing but according to the United Nations Statistics Division, China’s share of global manufacturing was &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/20858/top-10-countries-by-share-of-global-manufacturing-output/?srsltid=AfmBOoqhXEOW3_9o29PQac6itEdsMkh3NCLy7eyua03ML4BMs6oHcR0n"&gt;29 per cent&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. The scale of the projected transformation is therefore stark. China will gain around 16 percentage points in global manufacturing market share over the next five years, if the UNIDO predictions are borne out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also mean the global manufacturing hierarchy has been completely upended. Back in 2000, the &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/americas/united-states-america" title="United States of America"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; accounted for 25 per cent of global manufacturing while China had just 6 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The changing structure of global industrial production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inherent disruption that this scenario spells out for the West is sharpened by the fact that Chinese companies compete not only with mid-technology counterparts in the West but also at the apex of the tech pyramid. Research from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) shows that China leads the US in &lt;a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/aspis-two-decade-critical-technology-tracker/"&gt;57 out of 64&lt;/a&gt; critical technology categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, in the future, it may be the West’s technological leaders – many of them politically significant employers – that bear the disruptive brunt of China’s rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;China’s stranglehold on key industries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dominance of the supply chains that buttress China’s advances in manufacturing also give Beijing formidable commercial leverage – which it has proven willing to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-left embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;China has shown it is willing to use its trade and manufacturing dominance to advance its geopolitical goals. This must be a wake-up call for Western policymakers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should focus the minds of policymakers in Europe and the US to identify other industries in which &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/asia-pacific/china" title="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; exerts global dominance that could at some point in the future be used as leverage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these industries are well known. For solar panels, China’s share in all the manufacturing stages (such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules) exceeds 80 per cent, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary"&gt;International Energy Agency (IEA)&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the world’s top 10 suppliers of solar photovoltaic manufacturing equipment are all Chinese.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also dominates in wind power, accounting for &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-state-of-clean-technology-manufacturing/analysis"&gt;50 to 70 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of the manufacturing capacity for key components like nacelles, towers and blades.
