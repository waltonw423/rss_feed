Because support for net zero is dropping off a cliff. There was a poll just a couple of weeks ago to show that net zero has net zero support, which is a big turnaround in just a few months, and I think that Barnaby played a role in that, and the net zero promise we were made is not delivering and working for the Australian people. Because they’ve seen their power bills go up, and the jobs go offshore, and it’s time to think again about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s got nothing to do with One Nation.
