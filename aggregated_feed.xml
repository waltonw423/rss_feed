says the government needs to stop approving new coal and gas mines (something his party has been saying for years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The costs of not acting on climate change are astronomical and they’re already being felt in our communities through things like floods and bushfires and they’re also being felt in household budgets through things like a massive spike in insurance premiums …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they [Labor] don’t do things like protect forests and if they don’t do things like protect our climate, [the laws are] not going to be worth the paper they’re printed on.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe the most gobsmacking detail about the accidental release of Hadush Kebatu from HMP Chelmsford was this, from a delivery driver who was delivering equipment to the prison as he left: Kebatu, who was serving a sentence for sexual assault and was due to be deported, appeared baffled as he walked free, and lingered outside the gates for an hour and a half before heading away. “They [the officers] were basically sending him away, saying, ‘Go, you’ve been released, you go,’” the driver &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/witness-wanted-migrant-was-confused-and-directed-to-station-by-prison-staff-13457133"&gt;told Sky News&lt;/a&gt;. “He kept scratching his head and saying, ‘Where do I go, where do I go?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its face, that might look like incompetence. But the fiasco of Kebatu’s release may point to much bigger issues in the prison system. Yesterday, the justice secretary, David Lammy &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/27/prison-manager-has-been-scapegoated-over-hadush-kebatus-release-says-union"&gt;blamed “human error”&lt;/a&gt; – while the Prison Officers’ Association (POA) called the suspension of a single officer “unjust”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate crisis | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Humanity &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/28/change-course-now-humanity-has-missed-15c-climate-target-says-un-head"&gt;has failed to limit global heating to 1.5C&lt;/a&gt; and must change course immediately, the secretary general of the UN has warned. In his only interview before next month’s Cop30 climate summit, António Guterres acknowledged it is now “inevitable” that humanity will overshoot the target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reform UK &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Nigel Farage &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/27/nigel-farage-defends-mp-comments-racist-sarah-pochin"&gt;has defended remarks made by a Reform MP&lt;/a&gt; who said seeing adverts full of black and Asian people “drives her mad”. The Reform UK leader said if he felt Sarah Pochin’s words were “deliberately and genuinely racist”, he would have “taken action” against her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Fears grew for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/27/fears-civilians-sudan-paramilitary-rsf-capture-el-fasher"&gt;hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in El Fasher&lt;/a&gt; after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces said it had captured the city, which it has been besieging for more than a year in Sudan’s civil war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hurrican Melissa | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Jamaicans &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/27/jamaicans-take-shelter-as-hurricane-melissa-bears-down-as-category-5-storm"&gt;have started to take shelter from Hurricane Melissa&lt;/a&gt; as the category 5 storm neared the coast amid warnings of catastrophic flooding, landslides and extensive infrastructure damage.

The company also said it would seek an extension of this license if needed, to maintain the continuous operation of its international assets, adding that it had begun reviewing offers from potential buyers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lukoil, headquartered in Moscow, accounts for about 2% of global oil production. The company’s name is derived from the combination of three Siberian oil towns where it was founded: Langepas, Urai, and Kogalym.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company did not specify which assets would be sold off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among Lukoil’s most significant foreign holdings is a 75% stake in Iraq’s West Qurna 2 oil field, considered one of the world’s largest. According to Russia’s Interfax news agency, the field’s output exceeded 480,000 barrels per day in April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company also owns the Lukoil Neftohim Burgas refinery in Bulgaria, which has a capacity of 190,000 bpd and is the largest in the Balkans, and the Petrotel refinery in Romania.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lukoil supplies crude oil to Hungary and Slovakia, as well as to the STAR refinery in Turkey, owned by Azerbaijan’s SOCAR, which relies heavily on Russian oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the company possesses interests in oil terminals and retail fuel networks across Europe and participates in various upstream and downstream ventures in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, as well as in Africa and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previously, on October 15, Britain had also targeted Lukoil and Rosneft, along with 44 tankers believed to be part of a “shadow fleet”. These tankers, mostly older vessels with unclear ownership, were targeted as part of a broader effort to strengthen energy sanctions and reduce revenue to the Kremlin. Former U.S. President Donald Trump had also imposed Ukraine-related sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft on October 22.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://starfeu.com"&gt;starfeu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StarFEU-Commodity"&gt; /u/StarFEU-Commodity &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1ohzk5m/lukoil_will_sell_international_assets_after_new/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1ohzk5m/lukoil_will_sell_international_assets_after_new/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1ohzk5m/lukoil_will_sell_international_assets_after_new/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 03:48:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Complete Digitization of Leonardo da Vinci's Codex Atlanticus</title><link>https://www.openculture.com/2025/10/digitization-of-leonardo-da-vincis-codex-atlanticus.html</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45728975"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.openculture.com/2025/10/digitization-of-leonardo-da-vincis-codex-atlanticus.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 03:32:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Behind Taiwan’s ‘unification’ party, Chinese espionage — and a criminal gang</title><link>https://smallwarsjournal.com/2025/10/28/behind-taiwans-unification-party-chinese-espionage-and-a-criminal-gang/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Behind Taiwan’s ‘unification’ party, Chinese espionage — and a criminal gang By Katrina Northrop  and Pei-Lin Wu Published by: The Washington Post on September 29, 2025 Read the full analysis here.
