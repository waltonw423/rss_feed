The vague assertion quickly traveled among law enforcement agencies. It even made its way into a formal proclamation by Texas governor Greg Abbott, and was repeated by Republican Congress members as evidence of the dangers of Venezuelan immigrants and Democrats’ border policies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/venezuela-tren-de-aragua-gang-police"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 11:00:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Once the AI bubble pops, we’ll all suffer.

Management reiterated 9% EPS growth for 2025 ($1.75–$1.77) and 8% for 2026, signaling strong regulatory confidence despite rising financing costs. Q3 EPS of $0.50 benefited from a $0.12 per share reduction in O&amp;amp;M expenses, largely from non-recurring storm restoration savings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company faces a balancing act: sustaining high growth and funding massive infrastructure upgrades amid a $0.04 per share headwind from higher interest expenses.
