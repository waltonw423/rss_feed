For comparison, past sanctions already pushed Moscow to offer steep price reductions to India and China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This marks a sharp policy shift by President Trump, who only a week ago suggested a summit with Putin might be near. Washington has warned more measures could follow if Russia refuses a ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you think — will this accelerate the reshaping of global oil trade, or just reroute flows with bigger discounts?&lt;/p&gt;
