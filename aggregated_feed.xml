We had to go out there and find a lot of voters. We found a lot of support. It’s been a great campaign. The collapse of the Labour vote is there for everyone to see. It’s been a betrayal what Labour has done around here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going into next year we’re in a really good place. A big part of what we were trying to do here is to master our campaigning. We’ve trained so many people up on our systems.

Australia is the only continent that does not have the highly contagious strain of H5 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists observed unusual levels of mortality in elephant seals on Heard Island in recent days. There were no observations of unusual levels of mortality in other species present on the island, including penguins and other seabirds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing signs consistent with H5 bird flu in wildlife on Heard Island is not unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia has already faced restrictions on Gazprom and Surgutneftegas, hitting the top two exporters is unprecedented. Early impacts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Chinese state oil majors have suspended short-term Russian crude purchases.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Indian refiners are sharply cutting imports.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Crude oil prices jumped more than 5% on Thursday.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysts say the sanctions won’t stop Russian oil entirely, but they will force deeper discounts on sales, cutting Kremlin revenues. For comparison, past sanctions already pushed Moscow to offer steep price reductions to India and China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This marks a sharp policy shift by President Trump, who only a week ago suggested a summit with Putin might be near. Washington has warned more measures could follow if Russia refuses a ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you think — will this accelerate the reshaping of global oil trade, or just reroute flows with bigger discounts?&lt;/p&gt;
