This week, Sussan Ley is in danger of putting her own leadership ahead of the environment and ahead of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can’t split the bill. We need to do both, and we need to get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been consulting to death on these reforms, and both business and environment groups are crying out for reform to finally be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t make that any clearer. I’ve met the same number of times with the Coalition and the Greens. I’ve spoken as recently as yesterday with representatives from those parties. What we’re about is passing a bill that is good for the environment and good for business, and it’s up to the Coalition and the Greens to decide, are they prepared to do that, or are they going to go into their corners and fight for a bill that only delivers to the environment or only delivers to business?&lt;/p&gt;

Focus on low-carbon fuels, battery storage, and specialty chemicals</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1oh4o7s/singapore_allocates_300_hectares_on_jurong_island/</link><description>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singapore is earmarking additional space on Jurong Island, its manufacturing center, for renewable energy installations and a data center park, according to a joint announcement made Monday by the Singapore Economic Development Board and developer JTC Corporation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Roughly 300 hectares (equivalent to 741.32 acres), representing about 10% of Jurong Island’s total area and located on the island’s western edge, will be allocated for renewable energy projects and the production of low-carbon fuels, the agencies stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 3,000-hectare Jurong Island is central to Singapore’s energy and chemical sectors, housing two of the nation’s three refineries, which are operated by Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and PetroChina.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tan See Leng, Singapore’s minister in charge of energy, science, and technology, remarked at the Singapore International Energy Week conference on Monday that Jurong Island will serve as a global testing ground for innovative energy solutions and low-carbon technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The development will involve expanding facilities for renewable energy sources, including solar power, sustainable aviation fuel, low- or zero-carbon ammonia solutions for both power generation and maritime bunkering, and battery storage, according to the EDB and JTC. These initiatives include Singapore’s project focused on low- or zero-carbon ammonia power generation, as well as hydrogen-ready power plants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a separate move, 20 hectares of land will be designated for the development of Singapore’s largest data center park, designed to accommodate up to 700 megawatts of power capacity. Operators will benefit from Jurong Island’s established infrastructure, which includes shared energy storage and utility systems, a robust power supply, and access to emerging low-carbon energy sources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jurong Island will simultaneously pursue diversification and foster growth opportunities in specialty chemicals and sustainable products, along with expanding its battery storage infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tan noted that there has been increasing interest from specialty chemicals companies looking to expand their presence in Singapore, driven by the growing regional demand for higher-quality products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sembcorp Industries announced on Monday that it has been piloting a battery stacking solution at its existing Jurong Island energy storage system facility. This vertical expansion enhances storage capacity without increasing the physical footprint, increasing the energy storage system’s capacity from 285 to 326 megawatt-hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://starfeu.com"&gt;starfeu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StarFEU-Commodity"&gt; /u/StarFEU-Commodity &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1oh4o7s/singapore_allocates_300_hectares_on_jurong_island/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1oh4o7s/singapore_allocates_300_hectares_on_jurong_island/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1oh4o7s/singapore_allocates_300_hectares_on_jurong_island/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 03:52:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thousands without power in Queensland as Victoria experiences ‘terrifying’ winds after year’s wettest day</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/27/queensland-victoria-qld-brisbane-hail-storms-power-outages-wild-weather</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Wires brought down across greater Brisbane and Werribee resident tells ABC Radio of partner ‘lifted and dropped’ by huge wind&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/oct/27/epbc-environment-laws-ai-copyright-lobbying-transparency-federal-parliament-anthony-albanese-asean-sussan-ley-murray-watt-ntwnfb"&gt;Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get our &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;breaking news email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3"&gt;free app&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;daily news podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.energex.com.au/outages/outage-finder/emergency-outages-text-view/"&gt;26,000 households&lt;/a&gt; were without power in south-east Queensland on Monday morning after a severe thunderstorm passed over the state, with wind gusts topping 109km/h.
