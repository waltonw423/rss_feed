The rate was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/31/trump-canada-tariffs-order"&gt;raised to 35% by Trump&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did Carney respond to Trump’s fusillade?&lt;/strong&gt; His office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment last night. The prime minister was due to leave on Friday morning for a summit in Asia, while Trump is to do the same on Friday evening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/first-thing-trump-backs-down-on-sending-federal-troops-to-san-francisco"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/first-thing-trump-backs-down-on-sending-federal-troops-to-san-francisco</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 12:11:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Padlet (YC W13) Is Hiring in San Francisco and Singapore</title><link>https://padlet.jobs</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45693743"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://padlet.jobs</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 12:01:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Is Bolivia Ready for Paz?</title><link>https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/24/bolivia-runoff-election-paz-morales-economics/</link><description>The conservative president-elect has an economic crisis in his inbox.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/24/bolivia-runoff-election-paz-morales-economics/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 12:00:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says trade talks with Canada 'terminated' over anti-tariffs advert</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjrlmd4pmeo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss</link><description>The US president says he is axing negotiations over an advert that used Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjrlmd4pmeo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:55:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>US student handcuffed after AI system apparently mistook bag of chips for firearm</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/baltimore-student-ai-gun-detection-system-doritos</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Baltimore county high schools have gun detection system that alerts police if it sees what it deems suspicious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai"&gt;artificial intelligence system&lt;/a&gt;
