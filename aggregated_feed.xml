(See&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/28/labour-asylum-seekers-military-sites-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-reform-uk-yvette-cooper-uk-politics-live-news-latest-updates?page=with%3Ablock-6900a0858f084e54fb1012d8#block-6900a0858f084e54fb1012d8"&gt; 11.09am&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his speech this morning Kruger was a bit more forthcoming. He said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me be very clear. The growth of the civil service will be reversed. After falling in the wake of the global financial crisis, the headcount of the civil service rose again after Brexit – shame on the Tories – and it passed 500,000 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing works properly. It’s impossible to build anything. The streets are dirty and unsafe. Taxes and prices are far too high. Immigration is changing our country for the worse and far too fast. And we’re becoming poor, sick and unhappy. There is a malaise over Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These problems are complex. But the effective cause of them is simple. Since 1997 we have had governments that, firstly don’t share the attitude of the country they govern, and secondly, they aren’t properly in charge of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This announcement only reinforces climate policy as a dividing line in our politics, rather than being the unifying issue it once was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, for the Conservative party, it risks chasing votes from Reform at the expense of the wider electorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By undermining the judiciary we further erode public trust in the institutions of our democracy and therefore in democracy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I say to those seeking to villainise a judiciary that cannot easily answer back, who wilfully discredit our legal system for their own expediency – it’s time to show responsible leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not just about short-term decisions to make it easier to deal with public concerns about immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our support for human rights has its origin in Magna Carta. How we deal with issues of human rights is fundamental to our ability to deal with autocracies and dictatorships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world of power where the club of strong men want to carve the world up in their own interests, populism and polarisation are enablers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those politicians in the Western world who use populism and polarisation for their own short-term political ends risk handing a victory to our enemies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/28/labour-asylum-seekers-military-sites-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-reform-uk-yvette-cooper-uk-politics-live-news-latest-updates"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/28/labour-asylum-seekers-military-sites-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-reform-uk-yvette-cooper-uk-politics-live-news-latest-updates</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 13:22:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Sick: Indexed deduplicated binary storage for JSON-like data structures</title><link>https://github.com/7mind/sick</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45732552"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://github.com/7mind/sick</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 13:22:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Von der Leyen says EU ‘cannot tolerate’ disruption of airspace, calling balloons over Lithuania a ‘provocation’ – Europe live</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/28/zelenskyy-ukraine-peace-talks-putin-russia-alexander-lukashenko-belarus-europe-live-news-latest-updates</link><description>&lt;p&gt;She also added they back plans to step up EU investment in military equipment and they are ready to cover the financing needs of Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU’s &lt;strong&gt;von der Leyen&lt;/strong&gt; also gets asked about the balloons disrupting the Lithuanian airspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says she wants to &lt;strong&gt;“express my full solidarity” with Lithuania&lt;/strong&gt;, and calls it &lt;strong&gt;“a provocation, a hybrid threat,”&lt;/strong&gt; which “we cannot tolerate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re in for the long haul. &lt;strong&gt;We are ready to cover the financing needs of Ukraine, so that we are standing by Ukraine for as long as it takes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/28/zelenskyy-ukraine-peace-talks-putin-russia-alexander-lukashenko-belarus-europe-live-news-latest-updates"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/28/zelenskyy-ukraine-peace-talks-putin-russia-alexander-lukashenko-belarus-europe-live-news-latest-updates</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 13:21:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>House Republicans revive Biden ‘autopen’ claims in new report</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/republicans-biden-autopen</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Report offers no proof of wrongdoing but repeats disputed claims about Biden’s awareness of decisions in office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US House Republicans on Tuesday unveiled their long-promised report on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;’s use of the autopen during his presidency, largely rehashing public information while criticizing his time in office and making sweeping accusations about the workings of his White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;’ report does not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden’s knowledge or that he was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name.

The 1,045 MW Freedom Energy Center in Pennsylvania and 1,836 MW Guernsey Power Station in Ohio will expand Talen’s dispatchable generation fleet to over 13 GW. The new notes — 6.25% due 2034 and 6.5% due 2036 — carry no financial covenants, giving the company operational flexibility. However, if either acquisition falls through, Talen must redeem the related debt at full value, ensuring disciplined capital use. This move positions Talen as a key player in supplying reliable power for growing digital and AI data infrastructure demand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Material-Car261"&gt; /u/Material-Car261 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.panabee.com/news/talen-locks-in-3-9-billion-financing-to-acquire-2-881-mw-of-natural-gas-generation"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1oi5wgn/talen_energy_secures_39b_to_acquire_2881_mw_of/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1oi5wgn/talen_energy_secures_39b_to_acquire_2881_mw_of/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 10:39:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>All fail Caesar: students at eight schools taught wrong topic for final year 12 history exam</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/28/brisbane-state-high-school-wrong-caesar-year-12-exam</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Queensland checking all 172 schools sitting exam with pupils expected to claim special consideration after studying the wrong Roman emperor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/oct/28/federal-parliament-algae-report-senate-social-media-age-assurance-labor-coalition-anthony-albanese-sussan-ley-barnaby-joyce-telco-penalties-ntwnfb"&gt;Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get our &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;breaking news email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3"&gt;free app&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;daily news podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year 12 students from at least eight schools in Queensland were taught the wrong topic for their final history exams and authorities are now checking with 172 schools to see if any more were affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students were meant to study Julius Caesar, but the affected pupils instead learned about his nephew Augustus, according to the Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/28/brisbane-state-high-school-wrong-caesar-year-12-exam"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/28/brisbane-state-high-school-wrong-caesar-year-12-exam</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 10:37:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Japanese PM promises golden age in relations with US during Trump visit</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/donald-trump-sanae-takaichi-japan-prime-minister-rare-earths-agreement</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Sanae Takaichi says she will nominate Trump for peace prize as two leaders sign agreement on rare earths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/17/rare-earths-critical-minerals-explained"&gt;What are rare earths – explained in 30 seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, has pledged to realise a “golden age” in relations with the US and to “fundamentally reinforce” her country’s defence posture at the start of a visit by Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US president, who is in Japan on the second leg of a week-long &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-asia-tour-key-questions-xi-jinping-china-japan-south-korea-malaysia"&gt;tour of Asia&lt;/a&gt;, and Takaichi quickly signed an agreement laying out a framework to secure the mining and processing of rare earths and other minerals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/donald-trump-sanae-takaichi-japan-prime-minister-rare-earths-agreement"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/donald-trump-sanae-takaichi-japan-prime-minister-rare-earths-agreement</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 10:28:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Woman in her 80s found dead on Great Barrier Reef’s Lizard Island after failing to return to cruise ship</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/28/woman-in-her-80s-found-dead-on-great-barrier-reefs-lizard-island-after-failing-to-return-to-cruise-ship</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Police say death was ‘sudden and non-suspicious’ as investigations into incident continue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman in her 80s has been found dead after failing to board a cruise ship anchored off an island in the Great Barrier Reef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queensland police confirmed the woman had died on Lizard Island, about 240km from Cairns.
