But after a two-and-a-half hour phone call with Vladimir Putin, Trump swung back to Moscow-friendly talking points. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-donbas-region-end-russia-invasion"&gt;“Let it be cut the way it is,”&lt;/a&gt; he said, referring to Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes it was even worse.

 Authorities identified the deceased hostages as &lt;strong&gt;Arie Zalmanovich&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tamir Adar.&lt;/strong&gt; Their bodies were transported in coffins by the Red Cross and handed over to the Israeli military in the &lt;strong&gt;Gaza Strip.&lt;/strong&gt; A military ceremony attended by the chief rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces was planned for later in the day, Netanyahu’s office said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 The two were killed in &lt;strong&gt;kibbutz Nir Oz&lt;/strong&gt; during the 7 October 2023, attack by Hamas militants, which triggered the two-year war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Since the ceasefire began on 10 October, the remains of 15 hostages have been returned to Israel. Another 13 still need to be recovered in Gaza and handed over, a key element to the ceasefire agreement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Meanwhile, the burial of more than 50 Palestinians is set for Wednesday at a cemetery in &lt;strong&gt;Deir al-Balah, Gaza.&lt;/strong&gt; The bodies were displayed outside &lt;strong&gt;Nasser hospital in Khan Younis&lt;/strong&gt; ahead of burial. The 50 are among the 165 bodies of Palestinians that Israel has so far handed over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/22/israel-gaza-ceasefire-jd-vance-netanyahu-hamas-hostages-middle-east-latest-news-updates"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:42:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The times they are a changing</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1od8mau/the_times_they_are_a_changing/</link><description>&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/1od8mau/the_times_they_are_a_changing/"&gt; &lt;img alt="The times they are a changing" src="https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/K7Ze07rUyMR5RkkA-0lSClfA6OZ4TRPfmmkDEJ0y_sk.jpg" title="The times they are a changing" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I returned to Aberdeen, the oil capital of Europe.
